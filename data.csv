"HONEST M31s. HONEST PERFORMANCE. HONEST PRICE.","Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only. BUILD QUALITY. Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also. DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT. With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster. BATTERY. Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested. CAMERA. This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints. PROCESSOR. After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent. SOUND QUALITY. After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect. Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.","10 Aug 2020","Colour: Mirage Black Style name: 6GB RAM","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61jRxDbpx4L._SY88.jpg

"Jack of all trades!!","Ordered on Prime day, 6th August 12 AM. Received the phone on 8th August. All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment. Display is gorgeous. Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone. FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints. Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs 6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well). The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now. Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs?? M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind. The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner. Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around. Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks. Till then book your phone and wait for the delivery as it is back-ordered at this moment.","11 Aug 2020","Colour: Mirage Blue Style name: 8GB RAM","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FXPv+CAwL._SY88.jpg

"Best buy for the price!","Hi all, From Samsung M31s. Bought it on Amazon Prime day sale. Placed the order by 00:04 of 6th August (Day-1 of the sale) and got it very next day Noon 2pm itself. Kudos Amazon India. Grabbed it for 15,999 with a 2k coupon code and HDFC's 10% discount. But, ordered a Matte Back cover and Matte Temper glass (As it didn't come with the box and also wasn't available near me in Chennai). Delivery date is 18th to 25th Aug which is pathetic. I have to take care my SaM31s like a baby. Small review as per my knowledge - On-hand, its so good. (Earlier was using OnePlus 6) Size wise bit bigger that 1+6 (6.5"") Comparing to Nord, we have Memory card slot - no dependency. While updating the phone on first start, i felt bit heat. But later, it was fine. Charged a 100% and had an extensive usage (not a gamer). Battery lasts more than 36hrs (with Bluetooth earphone at times). Charging happened in 70-75 mins with intermediate usage in between. Earphone Jack available comparing to Nord, better than Bluetooth earphone which consumes charge and needs charge for earphones too. Settings - an ocean of settings, wonderful touch sensor and additional features for lock facilities. But, doesn't have indicator on the front face (which shows if notifications are received) No option to find app usage statistics. Audio - Its so good with clear audio in all needs. Photo - Video : Excellent quality of photos and Videos even in a 3x Zoom. Front camera is bit down. Macro Mode is giving a great pic of Close shots. Has Slowmo, Super slowmo, Hyperlapse, Panaroma. AR zone is pure magical. Different features for Front cam and Back cam. Reverse charging facility is amazing. But the box doesn't have USB - charge cable. Overall - M31s is a price worthy with sooo many options. EDIT : Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is fine, just on 10th day of my purchase, my phone fallen down with less than 1m height (slipped from hand) and display borken 💔 Handle with care.","10 Aug 2020","Colour: Mirage Black Style name: 6GB RAM","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51N698FX4vL._SY88.jpg","True","Elavarasan Natarajan","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M31s (Mirage Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-712/product-reviews/B07DJCJBB3/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=

"HONEST M31s. HONEST PERFORMANCE. HONEST PRICE.","Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only. BUILD QUALITY. Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also. DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT. With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster. BATTERY. Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested. CAMERA. This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints. PROCESSOR. After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent. SOUND QUALITY. After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect. Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.","10 Aug 2020","Colour: Mirage Black Style name: 6GB RAM","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61jRxDbpx4L._SY88.jpg

"Jack of all trades!!","Ordered on Prime day, 6th August 12 AM. Received the phone on 8th August. All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment. Display is gorgeous. Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone. FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints. Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs 6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well). The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now. Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs?? M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind. The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner. Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around. Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks. Till then book your phone and wait for the delivery as it is back-ordered at this moment.","11 Aug 2020","Colour: Mirage Blue Style name: 8GB RAM","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FXPv+CAwL._SY88.jpg

"Best buy for the price!","Hi all, From Samsung M31s. Bought it on Amazon Prime day sale. Placed the order by 00:04 of 6th August (Day-1 of the sale) and got it very next day Noon 2pm itself. Kudos Amazon India. Grabbed it for 15,999 with a 2k coupon code and HDFC's 10% discount. But, ordered a Matte Back cover and Matte Temper glass (As it didn't come with the box and also wasn't available near me in Chennai). Delivery date is 18th to 25th Aug which is pathetic. I have to take care my SaM31s like a baby. Small review as per my knowledge - On-hand, its so good. (Earlier was using OnePlus 6) Size wise bit bigger that 1+6 (6.5"") Comparing to Nord, we have Memory card slot - no dependency. While updating the phone on first start, i felt bit heat. But later, it was fine. Charged a 100% and had an extensive usage (not a gamer). Battery lasts more than 36hrs (with Bluetooth earphone at times). Charging happened in 70-75 mins with intermediate usage in between. Earphone Jack available comparing to Nord, better than Bluetooth earphone which consumes charge and needs charge for earphones too. Settings - an ocean of settings, wonderful touch sensor and additional features for lock facilities. But, doesn't have indicator on the front face (which shows if notifications are received) No option to find app usage statistics. Audio - Its so good with clear audio in all needs. Photo - Video : Excellent quality of photos and Videos even in a 3x Zoom. Front camera is bit down. Macro Mode is giving a great pic of Close shots. Has Slowmo, Super slowmo, Hyperlapse, Panaroma. AR zone is pure magical. Different features for Front cam and Back cam. Reverse charging facility is amazing. But the box doesn't have USB - charge cable. Overall - M31s is a price worthy with sooo many options. EDIT : Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is fine, just on 10th day of my purchase, my phone fallen down with less than 1m height (slipped from hand) and display borken 💔 Handle with care.","10 Aug 2020","Colour: Mirage Black Style name: 6GB RAM","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51N698FX4vL._SY88.jpg","True","Elavarasan Natarajan","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M31s (Mirage Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-712/product-reviews/B07DJCJBB3/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=

"Best buy for the price!","Hi all, From Samsung M31s. Bought it on Amazon Prime day sale. Placed the order by 00:04 of 6th August (Day-1 of the sale) and got it very next day Noon 2pm itself. Kudos Amazon India. Grabbed it for 15,999 with a 2k coupon code and HDFC's 10% discount. But, ordered a Matte Back cover and Matte Temper glass (As it didn't come with the box and also wasn't available near me in Chennai). Delivery date is 18th to 25th Aug which is pathetic. I have to take care my SaM31s like a baby. Small review as per my knowledge - On-hand, its so good. (Earlier was using OnePlus 6) Size wise bit bigger that 1+6 (6.5"") Comparing to Nord, we have Memory card slot - no dependency. While updating the phone on first start, i felt bit heat. But later, it was fine. Charged a 100% and had an extensive usage (not a gamer). Battery lasts more than 36hrs (with Bluetooth earphone at times). Charging happened in 70-75 mins with intermediate usage in between. Earphone Jack available comparing to Nord, better than Bluetooth earphone which consumes charge and needs charge for earphones too. Settings - an ocean of settings, wonderful touch sensor and additional features for lock facilities. But, doesn't have indicator on the front face (which shows if notifications are received) No option to find app usage statistics. Audio - Its so good with clear audio in all needs. Photo - Video : Excellent quality of photos and Videos even in a 3x Zoom. Front camera is bit down. Macro Mode is giving a great pic of Close shots. Has Slowmo, Super slowmo, Hyperlapse, Panaroma. AR zone is pure magical. Different features for Front cam and Back cam. Reverse charging facility is amazing. But the box doesn't have USB - charge cable. Overall - M31s is a price worthy with sooo many options. EDIT : Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is fine, just on 10th day of my purchase, my phone fallen down with less than 1m height (slipped from hand) and display borken 💔 Handle with care.","10 Aug 2020","Colour: Mirage Black Style name: 6GB RAM","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51N698FX4vL._SY88.jpg","True","Elavarasan Natarajan","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M31s (Mirage Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-712/product-reviews/B07DJCJBB3/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=

"HONEST M31s. HONEST PERFORMANCE. HONEST PRICE.","Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only. BUILD QUALITY. Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also. DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT. With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster. BATTERY. Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested. CAMERA. This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints. PROCESSOR. After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent. SOUND QUALITY. After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect. Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.","10 Aug 2020","Colour: Mirage Black Style name: 6GB RAM","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61jRxDbpx4L._SY88.jpg

"Jack of all trades!!","Ordered on Prime day, 6th August 12 AM. Received the phone on 8th August. All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment. Display is gorgeous. Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone. FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints. Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs 6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well). The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now. Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs?? M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind. The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner. Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around. Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks. Till then book your phone and wait for the delivery as it is back-ordered at this moment.","11 Aug 2020","Colour: Mirage Blue Style name: 8GB RAM","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FXPv+CAwL._SY88.jpg

"Best mid range device to leave Chinese devices..","An excellent device would not be an enough word to describe this phone. Got it through prime and Amazon delivered it before time once again delighted with wonderful service by Amazon and the device is a masterpiece. Loaded with awesome features like 1 click camera, 6000mah battery, reverse charging, bigger and butter smooth super amoled display. Samsung has started to capture the Indian market and that ultimately allow us as customers to get rid of data stealer and spy Chinese phones.

"Best buy for the price!","Hi all, From Samsung M31s. Bought it on Amazon Prime day sale. Placed the order by 00:04 of 6th August (Day-1 of the sale) and got it very next day Noon 2pm itself. Kudos Amazon India. Grabbed it for 15,999 with a 2k coupon code and HDFC's 10% discount. But, ordered a Matte Back cover and Matte Temper glass (As it didn't come with the box and also wasn't available near me in Chennai). Delivery date is 18th to 25th Aug which is pathetic. I have to take care my SaM31s like a baby. Small review as per my knowledge - On-hand, its so good. (Earlier was using OnePlus 6) Size wise bit bigger that 1+6 (6.5"") Comparing to Nord, we have Memory card slot - no dependency. While updating the phone on first start, i felt bit heat. But later, it was fine. Charged a 100% and had an extensive usage (not a gamer). Battery lasts more than 36hrs (with Bluetooth earphone at times). Charging happened in 70-75 mins with intermediate usage in between. Earphone Jack available comparing to Nord, better than Bluetooth earphone which consumes charge and needs charge for earphones too. Settings - an ocean of settings, wonderful touch sensor and additional features for lock facilities. But, doesn't have indicator on the front face (which shows if notifications are received) No option to find app usage statistics. Audio - Its so good with clear audio in all needs. Photo - Video : Excellent quality of photos and Videos even in a 3x Zoom. Front camera is bit down. Macro Mode is giving a great pic of Close shots. Has Slowmo, Super slowmo, Hyperlapse, Panaroma. AR zone is pure magical. Different features for Front cam and Back cam. Reverse charging facility is amazing. But the box doesn't have USB - charge cable. Overall - M31s is a price worthy with sooo many options. EDIT : Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is fine, just on 10th day of my purchase, my phone fallen down with less than 1m height (slipped from hand) and display borken 💔 Handle with care.","10 Aug 2020","Colour: Mirage Black Style name: 6GB RAM","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51N698FX4vL._SY88.jpg","True","Elavarasan Natarajan","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M31s (Mirage Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-712/product-reviews/B07DJCJBB3/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=

"HONEST M31s. HONEST PERFORMANCE. HONEST PRICE.","Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only. BUILD QUALITY. Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also. DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT. With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster. BATTERY. Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested. CAMERA. This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints. PROCESSOR. After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent. SOUND QUALITY. After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect. Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.","10 Aug 2020","Colour: Mirage Black Style name: 6GB RAM","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61jRxDbpx4L._SY88.jpg

"Jack of all trades!!","Ordered on Prime day, 6th August 12 AM. Received the phone on 8th August. All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment. Display is gorgeous. Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone. FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints. Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs 6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well). The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now. Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs?? M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind. The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner. Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around. Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks. Till then book your phone and wait for the delivery as it is back-ordered at this moment.","11 Aug 2020","Colour: Mirage Blue Style name: 8GB RAM","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FXPv+CAwL._SY88.jpg

Touch is just Excellent. 3. Phone looks really cool in hands. 4. Smart pop up feature is also good to have. 5. UI is good. 6. Speaker sound is good. 7. No issues in calls - No call drips using Airtel sim. Overall its very nice experience using this phone. I researched alot before burying this phone and i am happy that i made this choice. Cons - 1. Battery doesn't look like 6000 MAH it typically gives 1.5 days backup with single charge which other phone alao gives with relatively less Mah Battery. I was hoping to get little more backup 2.

Touch is just Excellent. 3. Phone looks really cool in hands. 4. Smart pop up feature is also good to have. 5. UI is good. 6. Speaker sound is good. 7. No issues in calls - No call drips using Airtel sim. Overall its very nice experience using this phone. I researched alot before burying this phone and i am happy that i made this choice. Cons - 1. Battery doesn't look like 6000 MAH it typically gives 1.5 days backup with single charge which other phone alao gives with relatively less Mah Battery. I was hoping to get little more backup 2. Processor  - Could have been better 3  No back cover for phone as it is hard to find in a market","10 Aug 2020","Colour: Mirage Black Style name: 6GB RAM","","True","Anand Sawant","4.0","Samsung Galaxy M31s (Mirage Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-712/product-reviews/B07DJCJBB3/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=

"Best buy for the price!","Hi all, From Samsung M31s. Bought it on Amazon Prime day sale. Placed the order by 00:04 of 6th August (Day-1 of the sale) and got it very next day Noon 2pm itself. Kudos Amazon India. Grabbed it for 15,999 with a 2k coupon code and HDFC's 10% discount. But, ordered a Matte Back cover and Matte Temper glass (As it didn't come with the box and also wasn't available near me in Chennai). Delivery date is 18th to 25th Aug which is pathetic. I have to take care my SaM31s like a baby. Small review as per my knowledge - On-hand, its so good. (Earlier was using OnePlus 6) Size wise bit bigger that 1+6 (6.5"") Comparing to Nord, we have Memory card slot - no dependency. While updating the phone on first start, i felt bit heat. But later, it was fine. Charged a 100% and had an extensive usage (not a gamer). Battery lasts more than 36hrs (with Bluetooth earphone at times). Charging happened in 70-75 mins with intermediate usage in between. Earphone Jack available comparing to Nord, better than Bluetooth earphone which consumes charge and needs charge for earphones too. Settings - an ocean of settings, wonderful touch sensor and additional features for lock facilities. But, doesn't have indicator on the front face (which shows if notifications are received) No option to find app usage statistics. Audio - Its so good with clear audio in all needs. Photo - Video : Excellent quality of photos and Videos even in a 3x Zoom. Front camera is bit down. Macro Mode is giving a great pic of Close shots. Has Slowmo, Super slowmo, Hyperlapse, Panaroma. AR zone is pure magical. Different features for Front cam and Back cam. Reverse charging facility is amazing. But the box doesn't have USB - charge cable. Overall - M31s is a price worthy with sooo many options. EDIT : Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is fine, just on 10th day of my purchase, my phone fallen down with less than 1m height (slipped from hand) and display borken 💔 Handle with care.","10 Aug 2020","Colour: Mirage Black Style name: 6GB RAM","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51N698FX4vL._SY88.jpg","True","Elavarasan Natarajan","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M31s (Mirage Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-712/product-reviews/B07DJCJBB3/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=

"HONEST M31s. HONEST PERFORMANCE. HONEST PRICE.","Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only. BUILD QUALITY. Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also. DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT. With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster. BATTERY. Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested. CAMERA. This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints. PROCESSOR. After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent. SOUND QUALITY. After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect. Bang for the bucks go for it.

"Jack of all trades!!","Ordered on Prime day, 6th August 12 AM. Received the phone on 8th August. All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment. Display is gorgeous. Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone. FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints. Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs 6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well). The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now. Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs?? M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind. The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner. Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around. Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks. Till then book your phone and wait for the delivery as it is back-ordered at this moment.","11 Aug 2020","Colour: Mirage Blue Style name: 8GB RAM","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FXPv+CAwL._SY88.jpg

"Best Buy with few compromise","I am using this for last 2-3 days now. This is my review after actually using this pgone in all aspects. Pros - 1. Canera - Excellent camera - Good low light photography.  64 Megapixel does uts wor. Inteli Cam is just awesome. 2. Display is just Superfine even in direct sunlight it works Excellent. Touch is just Excellent. 3. Phone looks really cool in hands. 4. Smart pop up feature is also good to have. 5. UI is good. 6. Speaker sound is good. 7. No issues in calls - No call drips using Airtel sim. Overall its very nice experience using this phone. I researched alot before burying this phone and i am happy that i made this choice. Cons - 1. Battery doesn't look like 6000 MAH it typically gives 1.5 days backup with single charge which other phone alao gives with relatively less Mah Battery. I was hoping to get little more backup 2.

"Best buy for the price!","Hi all, From Samsung M31s. Bought it on Amazon Prime day sale. Placed the order by 00:04 of 6th August (Day-1 of the sale) and got it very next day Noon 2pm itself. Kudos Amazon India. Grabbed it for 15,999 with a 2k coupon code and HDFC's 10% discount. But, ordered a Matte Back cover and Matte Temper glass (As it didn't come with the box and also wasn't available near me in Chennai). Delivery date is 18th to 25th Aug which is pathetic. I have to take care my SaM31s like a baby. Small review as per my knowledge - On-hand, its so good. (Earlier was using OnePlus 6) Size wise bit bigger that 1+6 (6.5"") Comparing to Nord, we have Memory card slot - no dependency. While updating the phone on first start, i felt bit heat. But later, it was fine. Charged a 100% and had an extensive usage (not a gamer). Battery lasts more than 36hrs (with Bluetooth earphone at times). Charging happened in 70-75 mins with intermediate usage in between. Earphone Jack available comparing to Nord, better than Bluetooth earphone which consumes charge and needs charge for earphones too. Settings - an ocean of settings, wonderful touch sensor and additional features for lock facilities. But, doesn't have indicator on the front face (which shows if notifications are received) No option to find app usage statistics. Audio - Its so good with clear audio in all needs. Photo - Video : Excellent quality of photos and Videos even in a 3x Zoom. Front camera is bit down. Macro Mode is giving a great pic of Close shots. Has Slowmo, Super slowmo, Hyperlapse, Panaroma. AR zone is pure magical. Different features for Front cam and Back cam. Reverse charging facility is amazing. But the box doesn't have USB - charge cable. Overall - M31s is a price worthy with sooo many options. EDIT : Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is fine, just on 10th day of my purchase, my phone fallen down with less than 1m height (slipped from hand) and display borken 💔 Handle with care.","10 Aug 2020","Colour: Mirage Black Style name: 6GB RAM","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51N698FX4vL._SY88.jpg","True","Elavarasan Natarajan","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M31s (Mirage Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-712/product-reviews/B07DJCJBB3/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=

"HONEST M31s. HONEST PERFORMANCE. HONEST PRICE.","Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only. BUILD QUALITY. Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also. DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT. With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster. BATTERY. Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested. CAMERA. This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints. PROCESSOR. After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent. SOUND QUALITY. After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect. Bang for the bucks go for it.

"Jack of all trades!!","Ordered on Prime day, 6th August 12 AM. Received the phone on 8th August. All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment. Display is gorgeous. Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone. FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints. Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs 6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well). The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now. Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs?? M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind. The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner. Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around. Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks.

"Strictly Satisfactory.  Definitely not a flagship experience.","Initial impression after using for one day. 1. The display is Gorgeous. Feels like a high end device 2. Specs say 6000 MaH battery. Power management is not up to the mark. Without using any power intensive app battery drain is quite pronounced and noticeable.  Hopefully Samsung will release a patch to fix this 3.Camera: Impressive.  Good lighting conditions result in beautiful and detailed shots. Struggles a bit during the low light conditions. Overall quite ok for the price. 4. Processor: Not the fastest out there  but does the job. Nothing to complain about 5. Fingerprint scanner is decent. 6. No back case in the box.

"Best buy for the price!","Hi all, From Samsung M31s. Bought it on Amazon Prime day sale. Placed the order by 00:04 of 6th August (Day-1 of the sale) and got it very next day Noon 2pm itself. Kudos Amazon India. Grabbed it for 15,999 with a 2k coupon code and HDFC's 10% discount. But, ordered a Matte Back cover and Matte Temper glass (As it didn't come with the box and also wasn't available near me in Chennai). Delivery date is 18th to 25th Aug which is pathetic. I have to take care my SaM31s like a baby. Small review as per my knowledge - On-hand, its so good. (Earlier was using OnePlus 6) Size wise bit bigger that 1+6 (6.5"") Comparing to Nord, we have Memory card slot - no dependency. While updating the phone on first start, i felt bit heat. But later, it was fine. Charged a 100% and had an extensive usage (not a gamer). Battery lasts more than 36hrs (with Bluetooth earphone at times). Charging happened in 70-75 mins with intermediate usage in between. Earphone Jack available comparing to Nord, better than Bluetooth earphone which consumes charge and needs charge for earphones too. Settings - an ocean of settings, wonderful touch sensor and additional features for lock facilities. But, doesn't have indicator on the front face (which shows if notifications are received) No option to find app usage statistics. Audio - Its so good with clear audio in all needs. Photo - Video : Excellent quality of photos and Videos even in a 3x Zoom. Front camera is bit down. Macro Mode is giving a great pic of Close shots. Has Slowmo, Super slowmo, Hyperlapse, Panaroma. AR zone is pure magical. Different features for Front cam and Back cam. Reverse charging facility is amazing. But the box doesn't have USB - charge cable. Overall - M31s is a price worthy with sooo many options.

"HONEST M31s. HONEST PERFORMANCE. HONEST PRICE.","Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only. BUILD QUALITY. Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also. DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT. With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster. BATTERY. Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested. CAMERA. This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints. PROCESSOR. After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent. SOUND QUALITY. After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect. Bang for the bucks go for it.

"Jack of all trades!!","Ordered on Prime day, 6th August 12 AM. Received the phone on 8th August. All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment. Display is gorgeous. Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone. FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints. Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs 6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well). The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now. Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs?? M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind. The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner. Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around. Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks.

"Best buy for the price!","Hi all, From Samsung M31s. Bought it on Amazon Prime day sale. Placed the order by 00:04 of 6th August (Day-1 of the sale) and got it very next day Noon 2pm itself. Kudos Amazon India. Grabbed it for 15,999 with a 2k coupon code and HDFC's 10% discount. But, ordered a Matte Back cover and Matte Temper glass (As it didn't come with the box and also wasn't available near me in Chennai). Delivery date is 18th to 25th Aug which is pathetic. I have to take care my SaM31s like a baby. Small review as per my knowledge - On-hand, its so good. (Earlier was using OnePlus 6) Size wise bit bigger that 1+6 (6.5"") Comparing to Nord, we have Memory card slot - no dependency. While updating the phone on first start, i felt bit heat. But later, it was fine. Charged a 100% and had an extensive usage (not a gamer). Battery lasts more than 36hrs (with Bluetooth earphone at times). Charging happened in 70-75 mins with intermediate usage in between. Earphone Jack available comparing to Nord, better than Bluetooth earphone which consumes charge and needs charge for earphones too. Settings - an ocean of settings, wonderful touch sensor and additional features for lock facilities. But, doesn't have indicator on the front face (which shows if notifications are received) No option to find app usage statistics. Audio - Its so good with clear audio in all needs. Photo - Video : Excellent quality of photos and Videos even in a 3x Zoom. Front camera is bit down. Macro Mode is giving a great pic of Close shots. Has Slowmo, Super slowmo, Hyperlapse, Panaroma. AR zone is pure magical. Different features for Front cam and Back cam. Reverse charging facility is amazing. But the box doesn't have USB - charge cable. Overall - M31s is a price worthy with sooo many options.

"HONEST M31s. HONEST PERFORMANCE. HONEST PRICE.","Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only. BUILD QUALITY. Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also. DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT. With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster. BATTERY. Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested. CAMERA. This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints. PROCESSOR. After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent. SOUND QUALITY. After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect. Bang for the bucks go for it.

"Jack of all trades!!","Ordered on Prime day, 6th August 12 AM. Received the phone on 8th August. All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment. Display is gorgeous. Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone. FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints. Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs 6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well). The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now. Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs?? M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind. The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner. Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around. Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks. Till then book your phone and wait for the delivery as it is back-ordered at this moment.","11 Aug 2020","Colour: Mirage Blue Style name: 8GB RAM","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FXPv+CAwL._SY88.jpg

It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind. The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner. Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around. Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks.

"Best buy for the price!","Hi all, From Samsung M31s. Bought it on Amazon Prime day sale. Placed the order by 00:04 of 6th August (Day-1 of the sale) and got it very next day Noon 2pm itself. Kudos Amazon India. Grabbed it for 15,999 with a 2k coupon code and HDFC's 10% discount. But, ordered a Matte Back cover and Matte Temper glass (As it didn't come with the box and also wasn't available near me in Chennai). Delivery date is 18th to 25th Aug which is pathetic. I have to take care my SaM31s like a baby. Small review as per my knowledge - On-hand, its so good. (Earlier was using OnePlus 6) Size wise bit bigger that 1+6 (6.5"") Comparing to Nord, we have Memory card slot - no dependency. While updating the phone on first start, i felt bit heat. But later, it was fine. Charged a 100% and had an extensive usage (not a gamer). Battery lasts more than 36hrs (with Bluetooth earphone at times). Charging happened in 70-75 mins with intermediate usage in between. Earphone Jack available comparing to Nord, better than Bluetooth earphone which consumes charge and needs charge for earphones too. Settings - an ocean of settings, wonderful touch sensor and additional features for lock facilities. But, doesn't have indicator on the front face (which shows if notifications are received) No option to find app usage statistics. Audio - Its so good with clear audio in all needs.

"HONEST M31s. HONEST PERFORMANCE. HONEST PRICE.","Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only. BUILD QUALITY. Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also. DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT. With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster. BATTERY. Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested. CAMERA. This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints. PROCESSOR. After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent. SOUND QUALITY. After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier.

"Jack of all trades!!","Ordered on Prime day, 6th August 12 AM. Received the phone on 8th August. All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment. Display is gorgeous. Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone. FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints. Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs 6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well). The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now. Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs?? M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind. The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner. Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say.

"Jack of all trades!!","Ordered on Prime day, 6th August 12 AM. Received the phone on 8th August. All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment. Display is gorgeous. Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone. FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints. Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs 6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well). The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now. Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs?? M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind. The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner. Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around. Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks. Till then book your phone and wait for the delivery as it is back-ordered at this moment.","11 Aug 2020","Colour: Mirage Blue Style name: 8GB RAM","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FXPv+CAwL._SY88.jpg

"Best buy for the price!","Hi all, From Samsung M31s. Bought it on Amazon Prime day sale. Placed the order by 00:04 of 6th August (Day-1 of the sale) and got it very next day Noon 2pm itself. Kudos Amazon India. Grabbed it for 15,999 with a 2k coupon code and HDFC's 10% discount. But, ordered a Matte Back cover and Matte Temper glass (As it didn't come with the box and also wasn't available near me in Chennai). Delivery date is 18th to 25th Aug which is pathetic. I have to take care my SaM31s like a baby. Small review as per my knowledge - On-hand, its so good. (Earlier was using OnePlus 6) Size wise bit bigger that 1+6 (6.5"") Comparing to Nord, we have Memory card slot - no dependency. While updating the phone on first start, i felt bit heat. But later, it was fine. Charged a 100% and had an extensive usage (not a gamer). Battery lasts more than 36hrs (with Bluetooth earphone at times). Charging happened in 70-75 mins with intermediate usage in between. Earphone Jack available comparing to Nord, better than Bluetooth earphone which consumes charge and needs charge for earphones too. Settings - an ocean of settings, wonderful touch sensor and additional features for lock facilities. But, doesn't have indicator on the front face (which shows if notifications are received) No option to find app usage statistics. Audio - Its so good with clear audio in all needs. Photo - Video : Excellent quality of photos and Videos even in a 3x Zoom. Front camera is bit down. Macro Mode is giving a great pic of Close shots. Has Slowmo, Super slowmo, Hyperlapse, Panaroma. AR zone is pure magical. Different features for Front cam and Back cam. Reverse charging facility is amazing. But the box doesn't have USB - charge cable. Overall - M31s is a price worthy with sooo many options.

"HONEST M31s. HONEST PERFORMANCE. HONEST PRICE.","Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only. BUILD QUALITY. Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also. DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT. With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster. BATTERY. Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested. CAMERA. This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints. PROCESSOR. After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent. SOUND QUALITY. After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect. Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.","10 Aug 2020","Colour: Mirage Black Style name: 6GB RAM","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61jRxDbpx4L._SY88.jpg

This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints. PROCESSOR. After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent. SOUND QUALITY. After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect. Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.","10 Aug 2020","Colour: Mirage Black Style name: 6GB RAM","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61jRxDbpx4L._SY88.jpg

"Jack of all trades!!","Ordered on Prime day, 6th August 12 AM. Received the phone on 8th August. All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment. Display is gorgeous. Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone. FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints. Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs 6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well). The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now. Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs?? M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind. The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner. Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around. Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks. Till then book your phone and wait for the delivery as it is back-ordered at this moment.","11 Aug 2020","Colour: Mirage Blue Style name: 8GB RAM","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71FXPv+CAwL._SY88.jpg

When turns into selife mode really shocked IS IT HD photo or Asian paints colored WALL.REALLY SHOCKED. THIS TIME SAMSUNG DISAPPOINTED. Videos display is also not so effective.

"Strictly Satisfactory.  Definitely not a flagship experience.","Initial impression after using for one day. 1. The display is Gorgeous. Feels like a high end device 2. Specs say 6000 MaH battery. Power management is not up to the mark. Without using any power intensive app battery drain is quite pronounced and noticeable.  Hopefully Samsung will release a patch to fix this 3.Camera: Impressive.  Good lighting conditions result in beautiful and detailed shots. Struggles a bit during the low light conditions. Overall quite ok for the price. 4. Processor: Not the fastest out there  but does the job. Nothing to complain about 5. Fingerprint scanner is decent. 6. No back case in the box. Will take time to get new case delivered.  Case is necessary as the back panel is quite slippery 7. I believe the cost should have around 17K instead of 19.5k...!

"Best Buy with few compromise","I am using this for last 2-3 days now. This is my review after actually using this pgone in all aspects. Pros - 1. Canera - Excellent camera - Good low light photography.  64 Megapixel does uts wor. Inteli Cam is just awesome. 2. Display is just Superfine even in direct sunlight it works Excellent. Touch is just Excellent. 3. Phone looks really cool in hands. 4. Smart pop up feature is also good to have. 5. UI is good. 6. Speaker sound is good. 7. No issues in calls - No call drips using Airtel sim. Overall its very nice experience using this phone. I researched alot before burying this phone and i am happy that i made this choice. Cons - 1. Battery doesn't look like 6000 MAH it typically gives 1.5 days backup with single charge which other phone alao gives with relatively less Mah Battery. I was hoping to get little more backup 2. Processor  - Could have been better 3  No back cover for phone as it is hard to find in a market","10 Aug 2020","Colour: Mirage Black Style name: 6GB RAM","","True","Anand Sawant","4.0","Samsung Galaxy M31s (Mirage Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-712/product-reviews/B07DJCJBB3/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=

"Best mid range device to leave Chinese devices..","An excellent device would not be an enough word to describe this phone. Got it through prime and Amazon delivered it before time once again delighted with wonderful service by Amazon and the device is a masterpiece. Loaded with awesome features like 1 click camera, 6000mah battery, reverse charging, bigger and butter smooth super amoled display.

"Best buy for the price!","Hi all, From Samsung M31s. Bought it on Amazon Prime day sale. Placed the order by 00:04 of 6th August (Day-1 of the sale) and got it very next day Noon 2pm itself. Kudos Amazon India. Grabbed it for 15,999 with a 2k coupon code and HDFC's 10% discount. But, ordered a Matte Back cover and Matte Temper glass (As it didn't come with the box and also wasn't available near me in Chennai). Delivery date is 18th to 25th Aug which is pathetic. I have to take care my SaM31s like a baby. Small review as per my knowledge - On-hand, its so good. (Earlier was using OnePlus 6) Size wise bit bigger that 1+6 (6.5"") Comparing to Nord, we have Memory card slot - no dependency. While updating the phone on first start, i felt bit heat. But later, it was fine. Charged a 100% and had an extensive usage (not a gamer). Battery lasts more than 36hrs (with Bluetooth earphone at times). Charging happened in 70-75 mins with intermediate usage in between. Earphone Jack available comparing to Nord, better than Bluetooth earphone which consumes charge and needs charge for earphones too. Settings - an ocean of settings, wonderful touch sensor and additional features for lock facilities. But, doesn't have indicator on the front face (which shows if notifications are received) No option to find app usage statistics. Audio - Its so good with clear audio in all needs. Photo - Video : Excellent quality of photos and Videos even in a 3x Zoom. Front camera is bit down. Macro Mode is giving a great pic of Close shots. Has Slowmo, Super slowmo, Hyperlapse, Panaroma. AR zone is pure magical. Different features for Front cam and Back cam. Reverse charging facility is amazing. But the box doesn't have USB - charge cable. Overall - M31s is a price worthy with sooo many options. EDIT : Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is fine, just on 10th day of my purchase, my phone fallen down with less than 1m height (slipped from hand) and display borken 💔 Handle with care.","10 Aug 2020","Colour: Mirage Black Style name: 6GB RAM","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51N698FX4vL._SY88.jpg","True","Elavarasan Natarajan","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M31s (Mirage Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-712/product-reviews/B07DJCJBB3/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=

"It's a great phone!","Awsome product. I had my doubts buying another Redmi device after my mom bought one for herself 1 year ago. It got the annoying ads problem. But so far I'm yet to see my first ad. You have to be careful the first time you switch on the phone out of the box and untick all the personalization stuffs. Same goes for the first time opening any apps after booting. If then, u'll probably never see any ads like me. The battery is what they promised and it holds up to more than 1and half days for moderate usage. And the fast charger is pretty cool. 1 hour from 0 to 100%. It has Navic which is really accurate(tested it with GPS). It's really big but its right for me since my hands are big too. But probably for lots of people they'll have to always use both their hands for operating the phone, my mom finds it pretty hard to use. So, my honest review is, in 2020 this is an awesome choice and great value for money if you have big hands.","17 May 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM/128GB Storage Colour: Interstellar Black","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61igWnB8ttL._SY88.jpg

"It's a great phone!","Awsome product. I had my doubts buying another Redmi device after my mom bought one for herself 1 year ago. It got the annoying ads problem. But so far I'm yet to see my first ad. You have to be careful the first time you switch on the phone out of the box and untick all the personalization stuffs. Same goes for the first time opening any apps after booting. If then, u'll probably never see any ads like me. The battery is what they promised and it holds up to more than 1and half days for moderate usage. And the fast charger is pretty cool. 1 hour from 0 to 100%. It has Navic which is really accurate(tested it with GPS). It's really big but its right for me since my hands are big too. But probably for lots of people they'll have to always use both their hands for operating the phone, my mom finds it pretty hard to use.

No special features added in Redmi Note 9 Pro Max which can be differentiate with Note 4.  Battery is not so good, it doesn't retain power long time.  Other company's mobile are giving some special technology like Samsung M31 (6000 mah battery, Amoled Screen, sony camera lense and so many features) in lesser price.  It is not a value for money, not a good product.  Why the company has fixed so high price? The answer I would like to know from company.

"It's a great phone!","Awsome product. I had my doubts buying another Redmi device after my mom bought one for herself 1 year ago. It got the annoying ads problem. But so far I'm yet to see my first ad. You have to be careful the first time you switch on the phone out of the box and untick all the personalization stuffs. Same goes for the first time opening any apps after booting. If then, u'll probably never see any ads like me. The battery is what they promised and it holds up to more than 1and half days for moderate usage. And the fast charger is pretty cool. 1 hour from 0 to 100%. It has Navic which is really accurate(tested it with GPS). It's really big but its right for me since my hands are big too. But probably for lots of people they'll have to always use both their hands for operating the phone, my mom finds it pretty hard to use. So, my honest review is, in 2020 this is an awesome choice and great value for money if you have big hands.","17 May 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM/128GB Storage Colour: Interstellar Black","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61igWnB8ttL._SY88.jpg

"It's a great phone!","Awsome product. I had my doubts buying another Redmi device after my mom bought one for herself 1 year ago. It got the annoying ads problem. But so far I'm yet to see my first ad. You have to be careful the first time you switch on the phone out of the box and untick all the personalization stuffs. Same goes for the first time opening any apps after booting. If then, u'll probably never see any ads like me. The battery is what they promised and it holds up to more than 1and half days for moderate usage. And the fast charger is pretty cool. 1 hour from 0 to 100%. It has Navic which is really accurate(tested it with GPS). It's really big but its right for me since my hands are big too. But probably for lots of people they'll have to always use both their hands for operating the phone, my mom finds it pretty hard to use.

No special features added in Redmi Note 9 Pro Max which can be differentiate with Note 4.  Battery is not so good, it doesn't retain power long time.  Other company's mobile are giving some special technology like Samsung M31 (6000 mah battery, Amoled Screen, sony camera lense and so many features) in lesser price.  It is not a value for money, not a good product.  Why the company has fixed so high price? The answer I would like to know from company.  After purchasing it feel nothing worthy with the set because I am still using Redmi note 4. Just looting with custom in the Covid 19 pandemic situation.  No discount isoffered in credit card nor no cost EMI nor Exchange in flash sale.  In the name of flash sale seller makes fool to us. This is my personal experience and opinion.  If any body hurts, I feel sorry, but I revealed the truth. You can get far better mobile with this price of ₹18, 500.

"It's a great phone!","Awsome product. I had my doubts buying another Redmi device after my mom bought one for herself 1 year ago. It got the annoying ads problem. But so far I'm yet to see my first ad. You have to be careful the first time you switch on the phone out of the box and untick all the personalization stuffs. Same goes for the first time opening any apps after booting. If then, u'll probably never see any ads like me. The battery is what they promised and it holds up to more than 1and half days for moderate usage. And the fast charger is pretty cool. 1 hour from 0 to 100%. It has Navic which is really accurate(tested it with GPS). It's really big but its right for me since my hands are big too. But probably for lots of people they'll have to always use both their hands for operating the phone, my mom finds it pretty hard to use. So, my honest review is, in 2020 this is an awesome choice and great value for money if you have big hands.","17 May 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM/128GB Storage Colour: Interstellar Black","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61igWnB8ttL._SY88.jpg

"It's a great phone!","Awsome product. I had my doubts buying another Redmi device after my mom bought one for herself 1 year ago. It got the annoying ads problem. But so far I'm yet to see my first ad. You have to be careful the first time you switch on the phone out of the box and untick all the personalization stuffs. Same goes for the first time opening any apps after booting. If then, u'll probably never see any ads like me. The battery is what they promised and it holds up to more than 1and half days for moderate usage. And the fast charger is pretty cool. 1 hour from 0 to 100%. It has Navic which is really accurate(tested it with GPS). It's really big but its right for me since my hands are big too. But probably for lots of people they'll have to always use both their hands for operating the phone, my mom finds it pretty hard to use.

No special features added in Redmi Note 9 Pro Max which can be differentiate with Note 4.  Battery is not so good, it doesn't retain power long time.  Other company's mobile are giving some special technology like Samsung M31 (6000 mah battery, Amoled Screen, sony camera lense and so many features) in lesser price.  It is not a value for money, not a good product.  Why the company has fixed so high price? The answer I would like to know from company.  After purchasing it feel nothing worthy with the set because I am still using Redmi note 4. Just looting with custom in the Covid 19 pandemic situation.  No discount isoffered in credit card nor no cost EMI nor Exchange in flash sale.  In the name of flash sale seller makes fool to us. This is my personal experience and opinion.  If any body hurts, I feel sorry, but I revealed the truth. You can get far better mobile with this price of ₹18, 500.

"It's a great phone!","Awsome product. I had my doubts buying another Redmi device after my mom bought one for herself 1 year ago. It got the annoying ads problem. But so far I'm yet to see my first ad. You have to be careful the first time you switch on the phone out of the box and untick all the personalization stuffs. Same goes for the first time opening any apps after booting. If then, u'll probably never see any ads like me. The battery is what they promised and it holds up to more than 1and half days for moderate usage. And the fast charger is pretty cool. 1 hour from 0 to 100%. It has Navic which is really accurate(tested it with GPS). It's really big but its right for me since my hands are big too. But probably for lots of people they'll have to always use both their hands for operating the phone, my mom finds it pretty hard to use. So, my honest review is, in 2020 this is an awesome choice and great value for money if you have big hands.","17 May 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM/128GB Storage Colour: Interstellar Black","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61igWnB8ttL._SY88.jpg

"It's a great phone!","Awsome product. I had my doubts buying another Redmi device after my mom bought one for herself 1 year ago. It got the annoying ads problem. But so far I'm yet to see my first ad. You have to be careful the first time you switch on the phone out of the box and untick all the personalization stuffs. Same goes for the first time opening any apps after booting. If then, u'll probably never see any ads like me. The battery is what they promised and it holds up to more than 1and half days for moderate usage. And the fast charger is pretty cool. 1 hour from 0 to 100%. It has Navic which is really accurate(tested it with GPS). It's really big but its right for me since my hands are big too. But probably for lots of people they'll have to always use both their hands for operating the phone, my mom finds it pretty hard to use.

No special features added in Redmi Note 9 Pro Max which can be differentiate with Note 4.  Battery is not so good, it doesn't retain power long time.  Other company's mobile are giving some special technology like Samsung M31 (6000 mah battery, Amoled Screen, sony camera lense and so many features) in lesser price.  It is not a value for money, not a good product.  Why the company has fixed so high price? The answer I would like to know from company.  After purchasing it feel nothing worthy with the set because I am still using Redmi note 4. Just looting with custom in the Covid 19 pandemic situation.  No discount isoffered in credit card nor no cost EMI nor Exchange in flash sale.  In the name of flash sale seller makes fool to us. This is my personal experience and opinion.  If any body hurts, I feel sorry, but I revealed the truth. You can get far better mobile with this price of ₹18, 500.

"No reason to buy Redmi Note 9 Pro Max","Please don't buy it. It's not a quality mobile, it just like Redmi Note 4.  No special features added in Redmi Note 9 Pro Max which can be differentiate with Note 4.  Battery is not so good, it doesn't retain power long time.  Other company's mobile are giving some special technology like Samsung M31 (6000 mah battery, Amoled Screen, sony camera lense and so many features) in lesser price.  It is not a value for money, not a good product.  Why the company has fixed so high price? The answer I would like to know from company.  After purchasing it feel nothing worthy with the set because I am still using Redmi note 4. Just looting with custom in the Covid 19 pandemic situation.  No discount isoffered in credit card nor no cost EMI nor Exchange in flash sale.  In the name of flash sale seller makes fool to us. This is my personal experience and opinion.  If any body hurts, I feel sorry, but I revealed the truth. You can get far better mobile with this price of ₹18, 500. Its a cheating with the customer because price is high but no quality improvement in comparison with Redmi Note 4.  I feel better Redmi note 4 with lesser price than 9 Pro Max.","31 Jul 2020","","","True","BHABATOSH DAS","1.0","Redmi Note 9 Pro Max (Interstellar Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) - 64MP Quad Camera & Latest 8nm Snapdragon 720G & Alexa Hands-Free | with 12 Months No Cost EMI","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-600/product-reviews/B07HGBMHTR/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"It's a great phone!","Awsome product. I had my doubts buying another Redmi device after my mom bought one for herself 1 year ago. It got the annoying ads problem. But so far I'm yet to see my first ad. You have to be careful the first time you switch on the phone out of the box and untick all the personalization stuffs. Same goes for the first time opening any apps after booting. If then, u'll probably never see any ads like me. The battery is what they promised and it holds up to more than 1and half days for moderate usage. And the fast charger is pretty cool. 1 hour from 0 to 100%. It has Navic which is really accurate(tested it with GPS). It's really big but its right for me since my hands are big too. But probably for lots of people they'll have to always use both their hands for operating the phone, my mom finds it pretty hard to use. So, my honest review is, in 2020 this is an awesome choice and great value for money if you have big hands.","17 May 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM/128GB Storage Colour: Interstellar Black","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61igWnB8ttL._SY88.jpg

"The Best Smartphone of 2019 | The Flagship King","==== A lengthy & brutally honest review. It's worth the read if you plan on purchasing this device. ==== I am a Design Specialist by Profession & also into Mobile Photography, hence I was hooked in using the Pixel 2XL. This phone is a worthy upgrade if you're transitioning from Galaxy S9 / Pixel 1 or 2 series / OnePlus 6, 6T & below / iPhone X or 7 and below. OnePlus 7T Pro is only an incremental upgrade over it's predecessor OnePlus 7 Pro. ===== What has been improved over the 7 Pro? ==== + Faster Processor. Snapdragon 855 Plus. + Adreno 640. Better Gaming Performance. + Better Haptic Motor. Same as the 7T. + Fast Charging. Warp 30T Technology. + Brighter Nits (Upto 1000 compared to 800 of 7 Pro) + Super Macro Mode, Night reading Modes, Android 10 out of the box, Better Nightscape 2.0. These software updates will be eventually updated for the 7 Pro as well. ==== What's in the Box? ==== OnePlus 7T Pro Device. User Manual. Transparent Silicon Case. SIM Ejector Tool. Warp 30T Charging Brick. Type C USB Cable. And some cool OnePlus Stickers. ==== Display ==== Firstly, OnePlus 7T Pro has a stunning display over its predecessors. I'm personally not a fan of notches nor do I click a lot of selfies, so I prefer the OnePlus 7T Pro's Fluid Display. Feels more luxurious over the 7T. It's marginally bigger to hold as well. I would recommend using a case so that the edges don't feel slippery. However, you should also note that in different lighting conditions, 7T Pro has glares at the curves due to the rounder corners which I believe is negligible. 90Hz is smoooooth. You would never want to get back to 60Hz once you're used to this. ==== Performance ==== Snapdragon 855 Plus is one of the best CPUs out there (at the time of writing this review) and with Adrena 640, it takes gaming and multi-tasking to another league. COD & PUB-G juices out at their best with 60FPS & is indeed smooth than imagined. 855 Plus is at par with the A13 Bionic from Apple. Haven't experienced any drops in frames. RAM Management is splendid & 8GB RAM is recommended unless you want to get the 12 Gig McLaren Edition to save on a few seconds everyday. ==== Camera ==== I honestly have to admit that it's not the best out there as I was expecting a leap from it's predecessors. It still uses the Sony IMX 586 (48 MP) for it's main sensor and it's Telephoto at 2.2X optical (3X lossless) and is at par with iPhone. But when compared with the GCam Mod, the OnePlus Camera seems to have improved a lot from it's previous versions. The Wide Angle is fairly okayish with some distortions being present at the edges. Nightscape is now available for Wide Angle shots too. ==== Video ==== If you're into Video Recording, then be a bit disappointed to hear this as it isn't the best while it can still take average videos without much shake utilizing the OIS and EIS at 1080P and just OIS at 4K 60FPS. It still doesn't shoot 4K in wide angle. Apple iPhone 11 takes the lead here. OIS and EIS combined together has a lot of warping and rolling shutter which is a turn off for video producers. It's still not an alternate for a Gimbal. The videos look oversaturated too which can be fixed by shooting on a Third Party app like Filmic Pro. ==== Software ==== This is one of the biggest features for you to switch to the OnePlus. Stock Android was butter smooth while I missed out on a lot of simple gestures like Longer Screenshots, Silence Button, Customized Navigational elements & much more which lacked on the Stock OS from Google. I would say Oxygen OS should be set as a benchmark for Google to include these incremental features on their upcoming flagships. Oxygen OS has presently the best OS Experience for Android. ==== Battery ==== Warp T30 is super fast. It helps you charge from 0-100 in lesser time than an episode on Netflix. Although not the fastest charger in the industry, it still gets through a day on heavy usage. ==== What could've been improved ==== - Minor improvements on Camera. - No ToF sensor - No Wireless Charging. - IP Rating. - Better silicon case should be included in their future upgrades. ==== Verdict ==== No doubt that the ASUS Fans would recommend the ROG 2. ROG 2 is hands down the best gaming phone with 120 HZ Display but lacks majorly on other aspects like software updates, Telephoto Camera, Splash Proof, Build Quality and security patches which are very essential for business professionals or regular consumers. ASUS is also not known to provide regular updates to it's consumers over the OnePlus which has a closely knit community among the developers and has more Brand Value than ASUS & nevertheless to mention that the OnePlus 7T Pro feels premium out of the box. If you're planning to upgrade from a device almost 2 years old then this would be the best upgrade in case you require a phone with no-notch and curved screen. 7T Pro feels very slippery when compared to the 7T. I wish they made smaller devices. Otherwise I would still recommend the 7T which is the best bang for your buck. If you still wish to own this but cannot afford the extra rupee on incremental updates (Fast Charging, 855 Plus) , my suggestion would be is to go for the OnePlus 7 Pro. It's still one of the best devices out there.","16 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713enCot+3L._SY88.jpg

"Its a complete Beast !!! Awesome mobile","I think I am the first one to write a review for this beauty :)  I ordered this at 11 PM in the night and It was there in my hand in the morning 9 AM. I have used iPhone X, Samsung s9 plus and Samsung s10 plus before coming to One Plus 7T.  My experience so far with this: 1. Display: It's amazing. Sharpness, brightness and 90Hz displays makes it one of the most beautiful displays. 2. Camera: All of my previous mobiles had great cameras. 7t Pro is nothing less than that. If you are a professional photographer, you might find differences. For a normal user, it's just perfect. 3. Battery: I am getting a very good battery backup. When I go to bed, it's 30%. 30T Warp charger is a booom. 4. Performance: Blazing and Lightning fast. 5. One of the USP of OnePlus mobiles is its Oxygen OS. After using iPhone and Samsungs One UI, I can tell you that it's the best. Lots of gestures, shortcuts and very lightweight. The only Con I think it has is its weight. It's on the heavier side but after using it for few days now, I am getting used to it. Go for it guys !! You won't regret.","15 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","True","BunnyDecoder","5.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"Perfect combination of OnePlus 7T and 7Pro","Amazing phone with an unbelievably smooth and vivid display. I had been using the OnePlus 5T before and a big fan of OnePlus cameras and OS.But I've always felt the OnePlus display wasn't good enough.This mobile just killed that thought. Highlights: 1)Buttery smooth, fast and bright display -The edge display is just wowwww. You just can't stop admiring it. 2)Excellent camera - The pictures come out so well in all kinds of lighting and modes. *Portrait*- The new zoom mode in portrait is just wow.Looks exactly like DSLR clicks. Macro - I love taking closeup shots of flowers and patterns and with this...you can get as close as 2.5 cms and click amazing shots. Nightscape - This area is a huge upgrade compared to my OnePlus 5t.You get crisp and clear pictures without any noise.The pictures are now to the mark of Pixel mobiles. Popup camera - If you are hesitant or doubtful about popup cameras...I am telling you there is nothing to worry...It is Soo smooth and quick that you never will notice it is a hardware controlled camera.Selfies have never been this better.Bright and sharp shots anytime. Video - Haven't really used much.Will update later 3)Dolby speakers - Excellent sound quality with awesome stereo effect.Once again a huge upgrade over the older models. 4)90 Hz refresh rate - Yes this one gives you a totally different experience when using your mobile.It is clearly faster and better than the usual 60Hz displays. 5)Build and design - Just perfect...It's sleek...stylish and neat. Loved the camera setup in OnePlus 7T but hated the circular bump.And I totally loved the edge display in OnePlus 7 pro.This device is just a perfect combination of the best features in the 7t and the 7pro and NOT an unwanted model like everyone is claiming. 6) Batter and charging - The charging is blazing fast and the battery very easily lasts a whole day,even with 90Hz refresh rate.","17 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-GmUVthbL._SY88.jpg

"The Best Smartphone of 2019 | The Flagship King","==== A lengthy & brutally honest review. It's worth the read if you plan on purchasing this device. ==== I am a Design Specialist by Profession & also into Mobile Photography, hence I was hooked in using the Pixel 2XL. This phone is a worthy upgrade if you're transitioning from Galaxy S9 / Pixel 1 or 2 series / OnePlus 6, 6T & below / iPhone X or 7 and below. OnePlus 7T Pro is only an incremental upgrade over it's predecessor OnePlus 7 Pro. ===== What has been improved over the 7 Pro? ==== + Faster Processor. Snapdragon 855 Plus. + Adreno 640. Better Gaming Performance. + Better Haptic Motor. Same as the 7T. + Fast Charging. Warp 30T Technology. + Brighter Nits (Upto 1000 compared to 800 of 7 Pro) + Super Macro Mode, Night reading Modes, Android 10 out of the box, Better Nightscape 2.0. These software updates will be eventually updated for the 7 Pro as well. ==== What's in the Box? ==== OnePlus 7T Pro Device. User Manual. Transparent Silicon Case. SIM Ejector Tool. Warp 30T Charging Brick. Type C USB Cable. And some cool OnePlus Stickers. ==== Display ==== Firstly, OnePlus 7T Pro has a stunning display over its predecessors. I'm personally not a fan of notches nor do I click a lot of selfies, so I prefer the OnePlus 7T Pro's Fluid Display. Feels more luxurious over the 7T. It's marginally bigger to hold as well. I would recommend using a case so that the edges don't feel slippery. However, you should also note that in different lighting conditions, 7T Pro has glares at the curves due to the rounder corners which I believe is negligible. 90Hz is smoooooth. You would never want to get back to 60Hz once you're used to this. ==== Performance ==== Snapdragon 855 Plus is one of the best CPUs out there (at the time of writing this review) and with Adrena 640, it takes gaming and multi-tasking to another league. COD & PUB-G juices out at their best with 60FPS & is indeed smooth than imagined. 855 Plus is at par with the A13 Bionic from Apple. Haven't experienced any drops in frames. RAM Management is splendid & 8GB RAM is recommended unless you want to get the 12 Gig McLaren Edition to save on a few seconds everyday. ==== Camera ==== I honestly have to admit that it's not the best out there as I was expecting a leap from it's predecessors. It still uses the Sony IMX 586 (48 MP) for it's main sensor and it's Telephoto at 2.2X optical (3X lossless) and is at par with iPhone. But when compared with the GCam Mod, the OnePlus Camera seems to have improved a lot from it's previous versions. The Wide Angle is fairly okayish with some distortions being present at the edges. Nightscape is now available for Wide Angle shots too. ==== Video ==== If you're into Video Recording, then be a bit disappointed to hear this as it isn't the best while it can still take average videos without much shake utilizing the OIS and EIS at 1080P and just OIS at 4K 60FPS. It still doesn't shoot 4K in wide angle. Apple iPhone 11 takes the lead here. OIS and EIS combined together has a lot of warping and rolling shutter which is a turn off for video producers. It's still not an alternate for a Gimbal. The videos look oversaturated too which can be fixed by shooting on a Third Party app like Filmic Pro. ==== Software ==== This is one of the biggest features for you to switch to the OnePlus. Stock Android was butter smooth while I missed out on a lot of simple gestures like Longer Screenshots, Silence Button, Customized Navigational elements & much more which lacked on the Stock OS from Google. I would say Oxygen OS should be set as a benchmark for Google to include these incremental features on their upcoming flagships. Oxygen OS has presently the best OS Experience for Android. ==== Battery ==== Warp T30 is super fast. It helps you charge from 0-100 in lesser time than an episode on Netflix. Although not the fastest charger in the industry, it still gets through a day on heavy usage. ==== What could've been improved ==== - Minor improvements on Camera. - No ToF sensor - No Wireless Charging. - IP Rating. - Better silicon case should be included in their future upgrades. ==== Verdict ==== No doubt that the ASUS Fans would recommend the ROG 2. ROG 2 is hands down the best gaming phone with 120 HZ Display but lacks majorly on other aspects like software updates, Telephoto Camera, Splash Proof, Build Quality and security patches which are very essential for business professionals or regular consumers. ASUS is also not known to provide regular updates to it's consumers over the OnePlus which has a closely knit community among the developers and has more Brand Value than ASUS & nevertheless to mention that the OnePlus 7T Pro feels premium out of the box. If you're planning to upgrade from a device almost 2 years old then this would be the best upgrade in case you require a phone with no-notch and curved screen. 7T Pro feels very slippery when compared to the 7T. I wish they made smaller devices. Otherwise I would still recommend the 7T which is the best bang for your buck. If you still wish to own this but cannot afford the extra rupee on incremental updates (Fast Charging, 855 Plus) , my suggestion would be is to go for the OnePlus 7 Pro. It's still one of the best devices out there.","16 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713enCot+3L._SY88.jpg

"Its a complete Beast !!! Awesome mobile","I think I am the first one to write a review for this beauty :)  I ordered this at 11 PM in the night and It was there in my hand in the morning 9 AM. I have used iPhone X, Samsung s9 plus and Samsung s10 plus before coming to One Plus 7T.  My experience so far with this: 1. Display: It's amazing. Sharpness, brightness and 90Hz displays makes it one of the most beautiful displays. 2. Camera: All of my previous mobiles had great cameras. 7t Pro is nothing less than that. If you are a professional photographer, you might find differences. For a normal user, it's just perfect. 3. Battery: I am getting a very good battery backup. When I go to bed, it's 30%. 30T Warp charger is a booom. 4. Performance: Blazing and Lightning fast. 5. One of the USP of OnePlus mobiles is its Oxygen OS. After using iPhone and Samsungs One UI, I can tell you that it's the best. Lots of gestures, shortcuts and very lightweight. The only Con I think it has is its weight. It's on the heavier side but after using it for few days now, I am getting used to it. Go for it guys !! You won't regret.","15 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","True","BunnyDecoder","5.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"Kindly Update the Camera Quality with next software updates","Hi, When I open my this most awaited phone, I just saw 2 major Draw Back 1st. The Camera Quality, Dear One Plus maker if we paid you 54000.00 (53999.00) then why we compromise with today's main features the CAMERA. The zoom quality is very poor, pic are RIP-UP,DURING ZOOM SHOT OR WHEN YOU SEE THE CAPTURED IMAGE WITH ZOOM. NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY AND SHOT IS ALSO POOR IN NIGHT PICTURES YOU SAW LOTS OF DOTS- RIP-UP. IMAGE NOT CAPTURED IN HIS ORIGINAL COLOR. THERE ARE LOTS OF ISSUES WITH CAMERA QUALITY. SO THINK ABOUT YOUR USERS AND GIVE A BEST QUALITY.

"Perfect combination of OnePlus 7T and 7Pro","Amazing phone with an unbelievably smooth and vivid display. I had been using the OnePlus 5T before and a big fan of OnePlus cameras and OS.But I've always felt the OnePlus display wasn't good enough.This mobile just killed that thought. Highlights: 1)Buttery smooth, fast and bright display -The edge display is just wowwww. You just can't stop admiring it. 2)Excellent camera - The pictures come out so well in all kinds of lighting and modes. *Portrait*- The new zoom mode in portrait is just wow.Looks exactly like DSLR clicks. Macro - I love taking closeup shots of flowers and patterns and with this...you can get as close as 2.5 cms and click amazing shots. Nightscape - This area is a huge upgrade compared to my OnePlus 5t.You get crisp and clear pictures without any noise.The pictures are now to the mark of Pixel mobiles. Popup camera - If you are hesitant or doubtful about popup cameras...I am telling you there is nothing to worry...It is Soo smooth and quick that you never will notice it is a hardware controlled camera.Selfies have never been this better.Bright and sharp shots anytime. Video - Haven't really used much.Will update later 3)Dolby speakers - Excellent sound quality with awesome stereo effect.Once again a huge upgrade over the older models. 4)90 Hz refresh rate - Yes this one gives you a totally different experience when using your mobile.It is clearly faster and better than the usual 60Hz displays. 5)Build and design - Just perfect...It's sleek...stylish and neat. Loved the camera setup in OnePlus 7T but hated the circular bump.And I totally loved the edge display in OnePlus 7 pro.This device is just a perfect combination of the best features in the 7t and the 7pro and NOT an unwanted model like everyone is claiming. 6) Batter and charging - The charging is blazing fast and the battery very easily lasts a whole day,even with 90Hz refresh rate.","17 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-GmUVthbL._SY88.jpg

The phone is really big and has lot of power in it, no problem in playing games, its like silk smooth games, navigation between apps, super fast. All updates were done for software and apps. I am in love with it.... But After 2 days of normal usage and random navigation on the device. The device started rebooting itself, I was shocked but thought maybe just after reboot it will ok. But it rebooted for 3 hours continuously without any stop, till the whole battery got drained. I was not able to perform any action, it made me handicapped for 3 hours, where I cannot do anything...

I had been using the OnePlus 5T before and a big fan of OnePlus cameras and OS.But I've always felt the OnePlus display wasn't good enough.This mobile just killed that thought. Highlights: 1)Buttery smooth, fast and bright display -The edge display is just wowwww. You just can't stop admiring it. 2)Excellent camera - The pictures come out so well in all kinds of lighting and modes. *Portrait*- The new zoom mode in portrait is just wow.Looks exactly like DSLR clicks. Macro - I love taking closeup shots of flowers and patterns and with this...you can get as close as 2.5 cms and click amazing shots. Nightscape - This area is a huge upgrade compared to my OnePlus 5t.You get crisp and clear pictures without any noise.The pictures are now to the mark of Pixel mobiles. Popup camera - If you are hesitant or doubtful about popup cameras...I am telling you there is nothing to worry...It is Soo smooth and quick that you never will notice it is a hardware controlled camera.Selfies have never been this better.Bright and sharp shots anytime. Video - Haven't really used much.Will update later 3)Dolby speakers - Excellent sound quality with awesome stereo effect.Once again a huge upgrade over the older models. 4)90 Hz refresh rate - Yes this one gives you a totally different experience when using your mobile.It is clearly faster and better than the usual 60Hz displays. 5)Build and design - Just perfect...It's sleek...stylish and neat. Loved the camera setup in OnePlus 7T but hated the circular bump.And I totally loved the edge display in OnePlus 7 pro.This device is just a perfect combination of the best features in the 7t and the 7pro and NOT an unwanted model like everyone is claiming. 6) Batter and charging - The charging is blazing fast and the battery very easily lasts a whole day,even with 90Hz refresh rate.","17 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-GmUVthbL._SY88.jpg

"The Best Smartphone of 2019 | The Flagship King","==== A lengthy & brutally honest review. It's worth the read if you plan on purchasing this device. ==== I am a Design Specialist by Profession & also into Mobile Photography, hence I was hooked in using the Pixel 2XL. This phone is a worthy upgrade if you're transitioning from Galaxy S9 / Pixel 1 or 2 series / OnePlus 6, 6T & below / iPhone X or 7 and below. OnePlus 7T Pro is only an incremental upgrade over it's predecessor OnePlus 7 Pro. ===== What has been improved over the 7 Pro? ==== + Faster Processor. Snapdragon 855 Plus. + Adreno 640. Better Gaming Performance. + Better Haptic Motor. Same as the 7T. + Fast Charging. Warp 30T Technology. + Brighter Nits (Upto 1000 compared to 800 of 7 Pro) + Super Macro Mode, Night reading Modes, Android 10 out of the box, Better Nightscape 2.0. These software updates will be eventually updated for the 7 Pro as well. ==== What's in the Box? ==== OnePlus 7T Pro Device. User Manual. Transparent Silicon Case. SIM Ejector Tool. Warp 30T Charging Brick. Type C USB Cable. And some cool OnePlus Stickers. ==== Display ==== Firstly, OnePlus 7T Pro has a stunning display over its predecessors. I'm personally not a fan of notches nor do I click a lot of selfies, so I prefer the OnePlus 7T Pro's Fluid Display. Feels more luxurious over the 7T. It's marginally bigger to hold as well. I would recommend using a case so that the edges don't feel slippery. However, you should also note that in different lighting conditions, 7T Pro has glares at the curves due to the rounder corners which I believe is negligible. 90Hz is smoooooth. You would never want to get back to 60Hz once you're used to this. ==== Performance ==== Snapdragon 855 Plus is one of the best CPUs out there (at the time of writing this review) and with Adrena 640, it takes gaming and multi-tasking to another league. COD & PUB-G juices out at their best with 60FPS & is indeed smooth than imagined. 855 Plus is at par with the A13 Bionic from Apple. Haven't experienced any drops in frames. RAM Management is splendid & 8GB RAM is recommended unless you want to get the 12 Gig McLaren Edition to save on a few seconds everyday. ==== Camera ==== I honestly have to admit that it's not the best out there as I was expecting a leap from it's predecessors. It still uses the Sony IMX 586 (48 MP) for it's main sensor and it's Telephoto at 2.2X optical (3X lossless) and is at par with iPhone. But when compared with the GCam Mod, the OnePlus Camera seems to have improved a lot from it's previous versions. The Wide Angle is fairly okayish with some distortions being present at the edges. Nightscape is now available for Wide Angle shots too. ==== Video ==== If you're into Video Recording, then be a bit disappointed to hear this as it isn't the best while it can still take average videos without much shake utilizing the OIS and EIS at 1080P and just OIS at 4K 60FPS. It still doesn't shoot 4K in wide angle. Apple iPhone 11 takes the lead here. OIS and EIS combined together has a lot of warping and rolling shutter which is a turn off for video producers. It's still not an alternate for a Gimbal. The videos look oversaturated too which can be fixed by shooting on a Third Party app like Filmic Pro. ==== Software ==== This is one of the biggest features for you to switch to the OnePlus. Stock Android was butter smooth while I missed out on a lot of simple gestures like Longer Screenshots, Silence Button, Customized Navigational elements & much more which lacked on the Stock OS from Google. I would say Oxygen OS should be set as a benchmark for Google to include these incremental features on their upcoming flagships. Oxygen OS has presently the best OS Experience for Android. ==== Battery ==== Warp T30 is super fast. It helps you charge from 0-100 in lesser time than an episode on Netflix. Although not the fastest charger in the industry, it still gets through a day on heavy usage. ==== What could've been improved ==== - Minor improvements on Camera. - No ToF sensor - No Wireless Charging. - IP Rating. - Better silicon case should be included in their future upgrades. ==== Verdict ==== No doubt that the ASUS Fans would recommend the ROG 2. ROG 2 is hands down the best gaming phone with 120 HZ Display but lacks majorly on other aspects like software updates, Telephoto Camera, Splash Proof, Build Quality and security patches which are very essential for business professionals or regular consumers. ASUS is also not known to provide regular updates to it's consumers over the OnePlus which has a closely knit community among the developers and has more Brand Value than ASUS & nevertheless to mention that the OnePlus 7T Pro feels premium out of the box. If you're planning to upgrade from a device almost 2 years old then this would be the best upgrade in case you require a phone with no-notch and curved screen. 7T Pro feels very slippery when compared to the 7T. I wish they made smaller devices. Otherwise I would still recommend the 7T which is the best bang for your buck. If you still wish to own this but cannot afford the extra rupee on incremental updates (Fast Charging, 855 Plus) , my suggestion would be is to go for the OnePlus 7 Pro. It's still one of the best devices out there.","16 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713enCot+3L._SY88.jpg

"Its a complete Beast !!! Awesome mobile","I think I am the first one to write a review for this beauty :)  I ordered this at 11 PM in the night and It was there in my hand in the morning 9 AM. I have used iPhone X, Samsung s9 plus and Samsung s10 plus before coming to One Plus 7T.  My experience so far with this: 1. Display: It's amazing. Sharpness, brightness and 90Hz displays makes it one of the most beautiful displays. 2. Camera: All of my previous mobiles had great cameras. 7t Pro is nothing less than that. If you are a professional photographer, you might find differences. For a normal user, it's just perfect. 3. Battery: I am getting a very good battery backup. When I go to bed, it's 30%. 30T Warp charger is a booom. 4. Performance: Blazing and Lightning fast. 5. One of the USP of OnePlus mobiles is its Oxygen OS. After using iPhone and Samsungs One UI, I can tell you that it's the best. Lots of gestures, shortcuts and very lightweight. The only Con I think it has is its weight. It's on the heavier side but after using it for few days now, I am getting used to it. Go for it guys !! You won't regret.","15 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","True","BunnyDecoder","5.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"Kindly Update the Camera Quality with next software updates","Hi, When I open my this most awaited phone, I just saw 2 major Draw Back 1st. The Camera Quality, Dear One Plus maker if we paid you 54000.00 (53999.00) then why we compromise with today's main features the CAMERA. The zoom quality is very poor, pic are RIP-UP,DURING ZOOM SHOT OR WHEN YOU SEE THE CAPTURED IMAGE WITH ZOOM. NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY AND SHOT IS ALSO POOR IN NIGHT PICTURES YOU SAW LOTS OF DOTS- RIP-UP. IMAGE NOT CAPTURED IN HIS ORIGINAL COLOR. THERE ARE LOTS OF ISSUES WITH CAMERA QUALITY. SO THINK ABOUT YOUR USERS AND GIVE A BEST QUALITY. Hope ONE PLUS Team look and work on it and solve this issue in his next software updates. Dear Amazon team pass this feedback to ONE PLUS TEAM.","22 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","True","@bhi","1.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

I wish they made smaller devices. Otherwise I would still recommend the 7T which is the best bang for your buck. If you still wish to own this but cannot afford the extra rupee on incremental updates (Fast Charging, 855 Plus) , my suggestion would be is to go for the OnePlus 7 Pro. It's still one of the best devices out there.","16 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713enCot+3L._SY88.jpg

"Its a complete Beast !!! Awesome mobile","I think I am the first one to write a review for this beauty :)  I ordered this at 11 PM in the night and It was there in my hand in the morning 9 AM. I have used iPhone X, Samsung s9 plus and Samsung s10 plus before coming to One Plus 7T.  My experience so far with this: 1. Display: It's amazing. Sharpness, brightness and 90Hz displays makes it one of the most beautiful displays. 2. Camera: All of my previous mobiles had great cameras. 7t Pro is nothing less than that. If you are a professional photographer, you might find differences. For a normal user, it's just perfect. 3. Battery: I am getting a very good battery backup. When I go to bed, it's 30%. 30T Warp charger is a booom. 4. Performance: Blazing and Lightning fast. 5. One of the USP of OnePlus mobiles is its Oxygen OS. After using iPhone and Samsungs One UI, I can tell you that it's the best. Lots of gestures, shortcuts and very lightweight. The only Con I think it has is its weight. It's on the heavier side but after using it for few days now, I am getting used to it. Go for it guys !! You won't regret.","15 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","True","BunnyDecoder","5.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"Kindly Update the Camera Quality with next software updates","Hi, When I open my this most awaited phone, I just saw 2 major Draw Back 1st. The Camera Quality, Dear One Plus maker if we paid you 54000.00 (53999.00) then why we compromise with today's main features the CAMERA. The zoom quality is very poor, pic are RIP-UP,DURING ZOOM SHOT OR WHEN YOU SEE THE CAPTURED IMAGE WITH ZOOM. NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY AND SHOT IS ALSO POOR IN NIGHT PICTURES YOU SAW LOTS OF DOTS- RIP-UP. IMAGE NOT CAPTURED IN HIS ORIGINAL COLOR. THERE ARE LOTS OF ISSUES WITH CAMERA QUALITY. SO THINK ABOUT YOUR USERS AND GIVE A BEST QUALITY.

"Perfect combination of OnePlus 7T and 7Pro","Amazing phone with an unbelievably smooth and vivid display. I had been using the OnePlus 5T before and a big fan of OnePlus cameras and OS.But I've always felt the OnePlus display wasn't good enough.This mobile just killed that thought. Highlights: 1)Buttery smooth, fast and bright display -The edge display is just wowwww. You just can't stop admiring it. 2)Excellent camera - The pictures come out so well in all kinds of lighting and modes. *Portrait*- The new zoom mode in portrait is just wow.Looks exactly like DSLR clicks. Macro - I love taking closeup shots of flowers and patterns and with this...you can get as close as 2.5 cms and click amazing shots. Nightscape - This area is a huge upgrade compared to my OnePlus 5t.You get crisp and clear pictures without any noise.The pictures are now to the mark of Pixel mobiles. Popup camera - If you are hesitant or doubtful about popup cameras...I am telling you there is nothing to worry...It is Soo smooth and quick that you never will notice it is a hardware controlled camera.Selfies have never been this better.Bright and sharp shots anytime. Video - Haven't really used much.Will update later 3)Dolby speakers - Excellent sound quality with awesome stereo effect.Once again a huge upgrade over the older models. 4)90 Hz refresh rate - Yes this one gives you a totally different experience when using your mobile.It is clearly faster and better than the usual 60Hz displays. 5)Build and design - Just perfect...It's sleek...stylish and neat. Loved the camera setup in OnePlus 7T but hated the circular bump.And I totally loved the edge display in OnePlus 7 pro.This device is just a perfect combination of the best features in the 7t and the 7pro and NOT an unwanted model like everyone is claiming. 6) Batter and charging - The charging is blazing fast and the battery very easily lasts a whole day,even with 90Hz refresh rate.","17 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-GmUVthbL._SY88.jpg

You have to get registered on their website. Why?! Display seems to have a bit of yellow tint. Although fast, not really seeing the so called magic of 90Hz display. Overhyped. Curved edges make reading a bit weird: Lines go up from the left (curve on the left), then flat in the middle and then go down on the right(curve on the right)- Wish the OS provided a margin on both edges,if needed.","18 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","True","AmazonCustomer","1.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"The Best Smartphone of 2019 | The Flagship King","==== A lengthy & brutally honest review. It's worth the read if you plan on purchasing this device. ==== I am a Design Specialist by Profession & also into Mobile Photography, hence I was hooked in using the Pixel 2XL. This phone is a worthy upgrade if you're transitioning from Galaxy S9 / Pixel 1 or 2 series / OnePlus 6, 6T & below / iPhone X or 7 and below. OnePlus 7T Pro is only an incremental upgrade over it's predecessor OnePlus 7 Pro. ===== What has been improved over the 7 Pro? ==== + Faster Processor. Snapdragon 855 Plus. + Adreno 640. Better Gaming Performance. + Better Haptic Motor. Same as the 7T. + Fast Charging. Warp 30T Technology. + Brighter Nits (Upto 1000 compared to 800 of 7 Pro) + Super Macro Mode, Night reading Modes, Android 10 out of the box, Better Nightscape 2.0. These software updates will be eventually updated for the 7 Pro as well. ==== What's in the Box? ==== OnePlus 7T Pro Device. User Manual. Transparent Silicon Case. SIM Ejector Tool. Warp 30T Charging Brick. Type C USB Cable. And some cool OnePlus Stickers. ==== Display ==== Firstly, OnePlus 7T Pro has a stunning display over its predecessors. I'm personally not a fan of notches nor do I click a lot of selfies, so I prefer the OnePlus 7T Pro's Fluid Display. Feels more luxurious over the 7T. It's marginally bigger to hold as well. I would recommend using a case so that the edges don't feel slippery. However, you should also note that in different lighting conditions, 7T Pro has glares at the curves due to the rounder corners which I believe is negligible. 90Hz is smoooooth. You would never want to get back to 60Hz once you're used to this. ==== Performance ==== Snapdragon 855 Plus is one of the best CPUs out there (at the time of writing this review) and with Adrena 640, it takes gaming and multi-tasking to another league. COD & PUB-G juices out at their best with 60FPS & is indeed smooth than imagined. 855 Plus is at par with the A13 Bionic from Apple. Haven't experienced any drops in frames. RAM Management is splendid & 8GB RAM is recommended unless you want to get the 12 Gig McLaren Edition to save on a few seconds everyday. ==== Camera ==== I honestly have to admit that it's not the best out there as I was expecting a leap from it's predecessors. It still uses the Sony IMX 586 (48 MP) for it's main sensor and it's Telephoto at 2.2X optical (3X lossless) and is at par with iPhone. But when compared with the GCam Mod, the OnePlus Camera seems to have improved a lot from it's previous versions. The Wide Angle is fairly okayish with some distortions being present at the edges. Nightscape is now available for Wide Angle shots too. ==== Video ==== If you're into Video Recording, then be a bit disappointed to hear this as it isn't the best while it can still take average videos without much shake utilizing the OIS and EIS at 1080P and just OIS at 4K 60FPS. It still doesn't shoot 4K in wide angle. Apple iPhone 11 takes the lead here. OIS and EIS combined together has a lot of warping and rolling shutter which is a turn off for video producers. It's still not an alternate for a Gimbal. The videos look oversaturated too which can be fixed by shooting on a Third Party app like Filmic Pro. ==== Software ==== This is one of the biggest features for you to switch to the OnePlus. Stock Android was butter smooth while I missed out on a lot of simple gestures like Longer Screenshots, Silence Button, Customized Navigational elements & much more which lacked on the Stock OS from Google. I would say Oxygen OS should be set as a benchmark for Google to include these incremental features on their upcoming flagships. Oxygen OS has presently the best OS Experience for Android. ==== Battery ==== Warp T30 is super fast. It helps you charge from 0-100 in lesser time than an episode on Netflix. Although not the fastest charger in the industry, it still gets through a day on heavy usage. ==== What could've been improved ==== - Minor improvements on Camera. - No ToF sensor - No Wireless Charging. - IP Rating. - Better silicon case should be included in their future upgrades. ==== Verdict ==== No doubt that the ASUS Fans would recommend the ROG 2. ROG 2 is hands down the best gaming phone with 120 HZ Display but lacks majorly on other aspects like software updates, Telephoto Camera, Splash Proof, Build Quality and security patches which are very essential for business professionals or regular consumers. ASUS is also not known to provide regular updates to it's consumers over the OnePlus which has a closely knit community among the developers and has more Brand Value than ASUS & nevertheless to mention that the OnePlus 7T Pro feels premium out of the box. If you're planning to upgrade from a device almost 2 years old then this would be the best upgrade in case you require a phone with no-notch and curved screen. 7T Pro feels very slippery when compared to the 7T. I wish they made smaller devices. Otherwise I would still recommend the 7T which is the best bang for your buck. If you still wish to own this but cannot afford the extra rupee on incremental updates (Fast Charging, 855 Plus) , my suggestion would be is to go for the OnePlus 7 Pro. It's still one of the best devices out there.","16 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713enCot+3L._SY88.jpg

"No 3.5 jack and overpriced.","No 3.5 headphone jack(Phone is thicker than 3.5 and there's plenty of space). No 3.5/C adapter provided in box. Never settle? No official adapter sold in Amazon either. You have to get registered on their website. Why?! Display seems to have a bit of yellow tint. Although fast, not really seeing the so called magic of 90Hz display. Overhyped.

"The Best Smartphone of 2019 | The Flagship King","==== A lengthy & brutally honest review. It's worth the read if you plan on purchasing this device. ==== I am a Design Specialist by Profession & also into Mobile Photography, hence I was hooked in using the Pixel 2XL. This phone is a worthy upgrade if you're transitioning from Galaxy S9 / Pixel 1 or 2 series / OnePlus 6, 6T & below / iPhone X or 7 and below. OnePlus 7T Pro is only an incremental upgrade over it's predecessor OnePlus 7 Pro. ===== What has been improved over the 7 Pro? ==== + Faster Processor. Snapdragon 855 Plus. + Adreno 640. Better Gaming Performance. + Better Haptic Motor. Same as the 7T. + Fast Charging. Warp 30T Technology. + Brighter Nits (Upto 1000 compared to 800 of 7 Pro) + Super Macro Mode, Night reading Modes, Android 10 out of the box, Better Nightscape 2.0. These software updates will be eventually updated for the 7 Pro as well. ==== What's in the Box? ==== OnePlus 7T Pro Device. User Manual. Transparent Silicon Case. SIM Ejector Tool. Warp 30T Charging Brick. Type C USB Cable. And some cool OnePlus Stickers. ==== Display ==== Firstly, OnePlus 7T Pro has a stunning display over its predecessors. I'm personally not a fan of notches nor do I click a lot of selfies, so I prefer the OnePlus 7T Pro's Fluid Display. Feels more luxurious over the 7T. It's marginally bigger to hold as well. I would recommend using a case so that the edges don't feel slippery. However, you should also note that in different lighting conditions, 7T Pro has glares at the curves due to the rounder corners which I believe is negligible. 90Hz is smoooooth. You would never want to get back to 60Hz once you're used to this. ==== Performance ==== Snapdragon 855 Plus is one of the best CPUs out there (at the time of writing this review) and with Adrena 640, it takes gaming and multi-tasking to another league. COD & PUB-G juices out at their best with 60FPS & is indeed smooth than imagined. 855 Plus is at par with the A13 Bionic from Apple. Haven't experienced any drops in frames. RAM Management is splendid & 8GB RAM is recommended unless you want to get the 12 Gig McLaren Edition to save on a few seconds everyday. ==== Camera ==== I honestly have to admit that it's not the best out there as I was expecting a leap from it's predecessors. It still uses the Sony IMX 586 (48 MP) for it's main sensor and it's Telephoto at 2.2X optical (3X lossless) and is at par with iPhone. But when compared with the GCam Mod, the OnePlus Camera seems to have improved a lot from it's previous versions. The Wide Angle is fairly okayish with some distortions being present at the edges. Nightscape is now available for Wide Angle shots too. ==== Video ==== If you're into Video Recording, then be a bit disappointed to hear this as it isn't the best while it can still take average videos without much shake utilizing the OIS and EIS at 1080P and just OIS at 4K 60FPS. It still doesn't shoot 4K in wide angle. Apple iPhone 11 takes the lead here. OIS and EIS combined together has a lot of warping and rolling shutter which is a turn off for video producers. It's still not an alternate for a Gimbal. The videos look oversaturated too which can be fixed by shooting on a Third Party app like Filmic Pro. ==== Software ==== This is one of the biggest features for you to switch to the OnePlus. Stock Android was butter smooth while I missed out on a lot of simple gestures like Longer Screenshots, Silence Button, Customized Navigational elements & much more which lacked on the Stock OS from Google. I would say Oxygen OS should be set as a benchmark for Google to include these incremental features on their upcoming flagships. Oxygen OS has presently the best OS Experience for Android. ==== Battery ==== Warp T30 is super fast. It helps you charge from 0-100 in lesser time than an episode on Netflix. Although not the fastest charger in the industry, it still gets through a day on heavy usage. ==== What could've been improved ==== - Minor improvements on Camera. - No ToF sensor - No Wireless Charging. - IP Rating. - Better silicon case should be included in their future upgrades. ==== Verdict ==== No doubt that the ASUS Fans would recommend the ROG 2. ROG 2 is hands down the best gaming phone with 120 HZ Display but lacks majorly on other aspects like software updates, Telephoto Camera, Splash Proof, Build Quality and security patches which are very essential for business professionals or regular consumers. ASUS is also not known to provide regular updates to it's consumers over the OnePlus which has a closely knit community among the developers and has more Brand Value than ASUS & nevertheless to mention that the OnePlus 7T Pro feels premium out of the box. If you're planning to upgrade from a device almost 2 years old then this would be the best upgrade in case you require a phone with no-notch and curved screen. 7T Pro feels very slippery when compared to the 7T. I wish they made smaller devices. Otherwise I would still recommend the 7T which is the best bang for your buck. If you still wish to own this but cannot afford the extra rupee on incremental updates (Fast Charging, 855 Plus) , my suggestion would be is to go for the OnePlus 7 Pro. It's still one of the best devices out there.","16 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713enCot+3L._SY88.jpg

"Its a complete Beast !!! Awesome mobile","I think I am the first one to write a review for this beauty :)  I ordered this at 11 PM in the night and It was there in my hand in the morning 9 AM. I have used iPhone X, Samsung s9 plus and Samsung s10 plus before coming to One Plus 7T.  My experience so far with this: 1. Display: It's amazing. Sharpness, brightness and 90Hz displays makes it one of the most beautiful displays. 2. Camera: All of my previous mobiles had great cameras. 7t Pro is nothing less than that. If you are a professional photographer, you might find differences. For a normal user, it's just perfect. 3. Battery: I am getting a very good battery backup. When I go to bed, it's 30%. 30T Warp charger is a booom. 4. Performance: Blazing and Lightning fast. 5. One of the USP of OnePlus mobiles is its Oxygen OS. After using iPhone and Samsungs One UI, I can tell you that it's the best. Lots of gestures, shortcuts and very lightweight. The only Con I think it has is its weight. It's on the heavier side but after using it for few days now, I am getting used to it. Go for it guys !! You won't regret.","15 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","True","BunnyDecoder","5.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"Kindly Update the Camera Quality with next software updates","Hi, When I open my this most awaited phone, I just saw 2 major Draw Back 1st. The Camera Quality, Dear One Plus maker if we paid you 54000.00 (53999.00) then why we compromise with today's main features the CAMERA. The zoom quality is very poor, pic are RIP-UP,DURING ZOOM SHOT OR WHEN YOU SEE THE CAPTURED IMAGE WITH ZOOM. NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY AND SHOT IS ALSO POOR IN NIGHT PICTURES YOU SAW LOTS OF DOTS- RIP-UP. IMAGE NOT CAPTURED IN HIS ORIGINAL COLOR. THERE ARE LOTS OF ISSUES WITH CAMERA QUALITY. SO THINK ABOUT YOUR USERS AND GIVE A BEST QUALITY.

"Perfect combination of OnePlus 7T and 7Pro","Amazing phone with an unbelievably smooth and vivid display. I had been using the OnePlus 5T before and a big fan of OnePlus cameras and OS.But I've always felt the OnePlus display wasn't good enough.This mobile just killed that thought. Highlights: 1)Buttery smooth, fast and bright display -The edge display is just wowwww. You just can't stop admiring it. 2)Excellent camera - The pictures come out so well in all kinds of lighting and modes. *Portrait*- The new zoom mode in portrait is just wow.Looks exactly like DSLR clicks. Macro - I love taking closeup shots of flowers and patterns and with this...you can get as close as 2.5 cms and click amazing shots. Nightscape - This area is a huge upgrade compared to my OnePlus 5t.You get crisp and clear pictures without any noise.The pictures are now to the mark of Pixel mobiles. Popup camera - If you are hesitant or doubtful about popup cameras...I am telling you there is nothing to worry...It is Soo smooth and quick that you never will notice it is a hardware controlled camera.Selfies have never been this better.Bright and sharp shots anytime. Video - Haven't really used much.Will update later 3)Dolby speakers - Excellent sound quality with awesome stereo effect.Once again a huge upgrade over the older models. 4)90 Hz refresh rate - Yes this one gives you a totally different experience when using your mobile.It is clearly faster and better than the usual 60Hz displays. 5)Build and design - Just perfect...It's sleek...stylish and neat. Loved the camera setup in OnePlus 7T but hated the circular bump.And I totally loved the edge display in OnePlus 7 pro.This device is just a perfect combination of the best features in the 7t and the 7pro and NOT an unwanted model like everyone is claiming. 6) Batter and charging - The charging is blazing fast and the battery very easily lasts a whole day,even with 90Hz refresh rate.","17 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-GmUVthbL._SY88.jpg

The phone is really big and has lot of power in it, no problem in playing games, its like silk smooth games, navigation between apps, super fast. All updates were done for software and apps. I am in love with it.... But After 2 days of normal usage and random navigation on the device. The device started rebooting itself, I was shocked but thought maybe just after reboot it will ok. But it rebooted for 3 hours continuously without any stop, till the whole battery got drained. I was not able to perform any action, it made me handicapped for 3 hours, where I cannot do anything...

Video - Haven't really used much.Will update later 3)Dolby speakers - Excellent sound quality with awesome stereo effect.Once again a huge upgrade over the older models. 4)90 Hz refresh rate - Yes this one gives you a totally different experience when using your mobile.It is clearly faster and better than the usual 60Hz displays. 5)Build and design - Just perfect...It's sleek...stylish and neat. Loved the camera setup in OnePlus 7T but hated the circular bump.And I totally loved the edge display in OnePlus 7 pro.This device is just a perfect combination of the best features in the 7t and the 7pro and NOT an unwanted model like everyone is claiming. 6) Batter and charging - The charging is blazing fast and the battery very easily lasts a whole day,even with 90Hz refresh rate.","17 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-GmUVthbL._SY88.jpg

"The Best Smartphone of 2019 | The Flagship King","==== A lengthy & brutally honest review. It's worth the read if you plan on purchasing this device. ==== I am a Design Specialist by Profession & also into Mobile Photography, hence I was hooked in using the Pixel 2XL. This phone is a worthy upgrade if you're transitioning from Galaxy S9 / Pixel 1 or 2 series / OnePlus 6, 6T & below / iPhone X or 7 and below. OnePlus 7T Pro is only an incremental upgrade over it's predecessor OnePlus 7 Pro. ===== What has been improved over the 7 Pro? ==== + Faster Processor. Snapdragon 855 Plus. + Adreno 640. Better Gaming Performance. + Better Haptic Motor. Same as the 7T. + Fast Charging. Warp 30T Technology. + Brighter Nits (Upto 1000 compared to 800 of 7 Pro) + Super Macro Mode, Night reading Modes, Android 10 out of the box, Better Nightscape 2.0. These software updates will be eventually updated for the 7 Pro as well. ==== What's in the Box? ==== OnePlus 7T Pro Device. User Manual. Transparent Silicon Case. SIM Ejector Tool. Warp 30T Charging Brick. Type C USB Cable. And some cool OnePlus Stickers. ==== Display ==== Firstly, OnePlus 7T Pro has a stunning display over its predecessors. I'm personally not a fan of notches nor do I click a lot of selfies, so I prefer the OnePlus 7T Pro's Fluid Display. Feels more luxurious over the 7T. It's marginally bigger to hold as well. I would recommend using a case so that the edges don't feel slippery. However, you should also note that in different lighting conditions, 7T Pro has glares at the curves due to the rounder corners which I believe is negligible. 90Hz is smoooooth. You would never want to get back to 60Hz once you're used to this. ==== Performance ==== Snapdragon 855 Plus is one of the best CPUs out there (at the time of writing this review) and with Adrena 640, it takes gaming and multi-tasking to another league. COD & PUB-G juices out at their best with 60FPS & is indeed smooth than imagined. 855 Plus is at par with the A13 Bionic from Apple. Haven't experienced any drops in frames. RAM Management is splendid & 8GB RAM is recommended unless you want to get the 12 Gig McLaren Edition to save on a few seconds everyday. ==== Camera ==== I honestly have to admit that it's not the best out there as I was expecting a leap from it's predecessors. It still uses the Sony IMX 586 (48 MP) for it's main sensor and it's Telephoto at 2.2X optical (3X lossless) and is at par with iPhone. But when compared with the GCam Mod, the OnePlus Camera seems to have improved a lot from it's previous versions. The Wide Angle is fairly okayish with some distortions being present at the edges. Nightscape is now available for Wide Angle shots too. ==== Video ==== If you're into Video Recording, then be a bit disappointed to hear this as it isn't the best while it can still take average videos without much shake utilizing the OIS and EIS at 1080P and just OIS at 4K 60FPS. It still doesn't shoot 4K in wide angle. Apple iPhone 11 takes the lead here. OIS and EIS combined together has a lot of warping and rolling shutter which is a turn off for video producers. It's still not an alternate for a Gimbal. The videos look oversaturated too which can be fixed by shooting on a Third Party app like Filmic Pro. ==== Software ==== This is one of the biggest features for you to switch to the OnePlus. Stock Android was butter smooth while I missed out on a lot of simple gestures like Longer Screenshots, Silence Button, Customized Navigational elements & much more which lacked on the Stock OS from Google. I would say Oxygen OS should be set as a benchmark for Google to include these incremental features on their upcoming flagships. Oxygen OS has presently the best OS Experience for Android. ==== Battery ==== Warp T30 is super fast. It helps you charge from 0-100 in lesser time than an episode on Netflix. Although not the fastest charger in the industry, it still gets through a day on heavy usage. ==== What could've been improved ==== - Minor improvements on Camera. - No ToF sensor - No Wireless Charging. - IP Rating. - Better silicon case should be included in their future upgrades. ==== Verdict ==== No doubt that the ASUS Fans would recommend the ROG 2. ROG 2 is hands down the best gaming phone with 120 HZ Display but lacks majorly on other aspects like software updates, Telephoto Camera, Splash Proof, Build Quality and security patches which are very essential for business professionals or regular consumers. ASUS is also not known to provide regular updates to it's consumers over the OnePlus which has a closely knit community among the developers and has more Brand Value than ASUS & nevertheless to mention that the OnePlus 7T Pro feels premium out of the box. If you're planning to upgrade from a device almost 2 years old then this would be the best upgrade in case you require a phone with no-notch and curved screen. 7T Pro feels very slippery when compared to the 7T. I wish they made smaller devices. Otherwise I would still recommend the 7T which is the best bang for your buck. If you still wish to own this but cannot afford the extra rupee on incremental updates (Fast Charging, 855 Plus) , my suggestion would be is to go for the OnePlus 7 Pro. It's still one of the best devices out there.","16 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713enCot+3L._SY88.jpg

"Its a complete Beast !!! Awesome mobile","I think I am the first one to write a review for this beauty :)  I ordered this at 11 PM in the night and It was there in my hand in the morning 9 AM. I have used iPhone X, Samsung s9 plus and Samsung s10 plus before coming to One Plus 7T.  My experience so far with this: 1. Display: It's amazing. Sharpness, brightness and 90Hz displays makes it one of the most beautiful displays. 2. Camera: All of my previous mobiles had great cameras. 7t Pro is nothing less than that. If you are a professional photographer, you might find differences. For a normal user, it's just perfect. 3. Battery: I am getting a very good battery backup. When I go to bed, it's 30%. 30T Warp charger is a booom. 4. Performance: Blazing and Lightning fast. 5. One of the USP of OnePlus mobiles is its Oxygen OS. After using iPhone and Samsungs One UI, I can tell you that it's the best. Lots of gestures, shortcuts and very lightweight. The only Con I think it has is its weight. It's on the heavier side but after using it for few days now, I am getting used to it. Go for it guys !! You won't regret.","15 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","True","BunnyDecoder","5.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"Kindly Update the Camera Quality with next software updates","Hi, When I open my this most awaited phone, I just saw 2 major Draw Back 1st. The Camera Quality, Dear One Plus maker if we paid you 54000.00 (53999.00) then why we compromise with today's main features the CAMERA. The zoom quality is very poor, pic are RIP-UP,DURING ZOOM SHOT OR WHEN YOU SEE THE CAPTURED IMAGE WITH ZOOM. NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY AND SHOT IS ALSO POOR IN NIGHT PICTURES YOU SAW LOTS OF DOTS- RIP-UP. IMAGE NOT CAPTURED IN HIS ORIGINAL COLOR. THERE ARE LOTS OF ISSUES WITH CAMERA QUALITY. SO THINK ABOUT YOUR USERS AND GIVE A BEST QUALITY. Hope ONE PLUS Team look and work on it and solve this issue in his next software updates. Dear Amazon team pass this feedback to ONE PLUS TEAM.","22 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","True","@bhi","1.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"Perfect combination of OnePlus 7T and 7Pro","Amazing phone with an unbelievably smooth and vivid display. I had been using the OnePlus 5T before and a big fan of OnePlus cameras and OS.But I've always felt the OnePlus display wasn't good enough.This mobile just killed that thought. Highlights: 1)Buttery smooth, fast and bright display -The edge display is just wowwww. You just can't stop admiring it. 2)Excellent camera - The pictures come out so well in all kinds of lighting and modes. *Portrait*- The new zoom mode in portrait is just wow.Looks exactly like DSLR clicks. Macro - I love taking closeup shots of flowers and patterns and with this...you can get as close as 2.5 cms and click amazing shots. Nightscape - This area is a huge upgrade compared to my OnePlus 5t.You get crisp and clear pictures without any noise.The pictures are now to the mark of Pixel mobiles. Popup camera - If you are hesitant or doubtful about popup cameras...I am telling you there is nothing to worry...It is Soo smooth and quick that you never will notice it is a hardware controlled camera.Selfies have never been this better.Bright and sharp shots anytime.

"Its a complete Beast !!! Awesome mobile","I think I am the first one to write a review for this beauty :)  I ordered this at 11 PM in the night and It was there in my hand in the morning 9 AM. I have used iPhone X, Samsung s9 plus and Samsung s10 plus before coming to One Plus 7T.  My experience so far with this: 1. Display: It's amazing. Sharpness, brightness and 90Hz displays makes it one of the most beautiful displays. 2. Camera: All of my previous mobiles had great cameras. 7t Pro is nothing less than that. If you are a professional photographer, you might find differences. For a normal user, it's just perfect. 3. Battery: I am getting a very good battery backup. When I go to bed, it's 30%. 30T Warp charger is a booom. 4. Performance: Blazing and Lightning fast. 5. One of the USP of OnePlus mobiles is its Oxygen OS. After using iPhone and Samsungs One UI, I can tell you that it's the best. Lots of gestures, shortcuts and very lightweight. The only Con I think it has is its weight. It's on the heavier side but after using it for few days now, I am getting used to it. Go for it guys !! You won't regret.","15 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","True","BunnyDecoder","5.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"Kindly Update the Camera Quality with next software updates","Hi, When I open my this most awaited phone, I just saw 2 major Draw Back 1st. The Camera Quality, Dear One Plus maker if we paid you 54000.00 (53999.00) then why we compromise with today's main features the CAMERA. The zoom quality is very poor, pic are RIP-UP,DURING ZOOM SHOT OR WHEN YOU SEE THE CAPTURED IMAGE WITH ZOOM. NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY AND SHOT IS ALSO POOR IN NIGHT PICTURES YOU SAW LOTS OF DOTS- RIP-UP. IMAGE NOT CAPTURED IN HIS ORIGINAL COLOR. THERE ARE LOTS OF ISSUES WITH CAMERA QUALITY. SO THINK ABOUT YOUR USERS AND GIVE A BEST QUALITY.

"Perfect combination of OnePlus 7T and 7Pro","Amazing phone with an unbelievably smooth and vivid display. I had been using the OnePlus 5T before and a big fan of OnePlus cameras and OS.But I've always felt the OnePlus display wasn't good enough.This mobile just killed that thought. Highlights: 1)Buttery smooth, fast and bright display -The edge display is just wowwww. You just can't stop admiring it. 2)Excellent camera - The pictures come out so well in all kinds of lighting and modes. *Portrait*- The new zoom mode in portrait is just wow.Looks exactly like DSLR clicks. Macro - I love taking closeup shots of flowers and patterns and with this...you can get as close as 2.5 cms and click amazing shots. Nightscape - This area is a huge upgrade compared to my OnePlus 5t.You get crisp and clear pictures without any noise.The pictures are now to the mark of Pixel mobiles. Popup camera - If you are hesitant or doubtful about popup cameras...I am telling you there is nothing to worry...It is Soo smooth and quick that you never will notice it is a hardware controlled camera.Selfies have never been this better.Bright and sharp shots anytime. Video - Haven't really used much.Will update later 3)Dolby speakers - Excellent sound quality with awesome stereo effect.Once again a huge upgrade over the older models. 4)90 Hz refresh rate - Yes this one gives you a totally different experience when using your mobile.It is clearly faster and better than the usual 60Hz displays. 5)Build and design - Just perfect...It's sleek...stylish and neat. Loved the camera setup in OnePlus 7T but hated the circular bump.And I totally loved the edge display in OnePlus 7 pro.This device is just a perfect combination of the best features in the 7t and the 7pro and NOT an unwanted model like everyone is claiming. 6) Batter and charging - The charging is blazing fast and the battery very easily lasts a whole day,even with 90Hz refresh rate.","17 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-GmUVthbL._SY88.jpg

"The Best Smartphone of 2019 | The Flagship King","==== A lengthy & brutally honest review. It's worth the read if you plan on purchasing this device. ==== I am a Design Specialist by Profession & also into Mobile Photography, hence I was hooked in using the Pixel 2XL. This phone is a worthy upgrade if you're transitioning from Galaxy S9 / Pixel 1 or 2 series / OnePlus 6, 6T & below / iPhone X or 7 and below. OnePlus 7T Pro is only an incremental upgrade over it's predecessor OnePlus 7 Pro. ===== What has been improved over the 7 Pro? ==== + Faster Processor. Snapdragon 855 Plus. + Adreno 640. Better Gaming Performance. + Better Haptic Motor. Same as the 7T. + Fast Charging. Warp 30T Technology. + Brighter Nits (Upto 1000 compared to 800 of 7 Pro) + Super Macro Mode, Night reading Modes, Android 10 out of the box, Better Nightscape 2.0. These software updates will be eventually updated for the 7 Pro as well. ==== What's in the Box? ==== OnePlus 7T Pro Device. User Manual. Transparent Silicon Case. SIM Ejector Tool. Warp 30T Charging Brick. Type C USB Cable. And some cool OnePlus Stickers. ==== Display ==== Firstly, OnePlus 7T Pro has a stunning display over its predecessors. I'm personally not a fan of notches nor do I click a lot of selfies, so I prefer the OnePlus 7T Pro's Fluid Display. Feels more luxurious over the 7T. It's marginally bigger to hold as well. I would recommend using a case so that the edges don't feel slippery. However, you should also note that in different lighting conditions, 7T Pro has glares at the curves due to the rounder corners which I believe is negligible. 90Hz is smoooooth. You would never want to get back to 60Hz once you're used to this. ==== Performance ==== Snapdragon 855 Plus is one of the best CPUs out there (at the time of writing this review) and with Adrena 640, it takes gaming and multi-tasking to another league. COD & PUB-G juices out at their best with 60FPS & is indeed smooth than imagined. 855 Plus is at par with the A13 Bionic from Apple. Haven't experienced any drops in frames. RAM Management is splendid & 8GB RAM is recommended unless you want to get the 12 Gig McLaren Edition to save on a few seconds everyday. ==== Camera ==== I honestly have to admit that it's not the best out there as I was expecting a leap from it's predecessors. It still uses the Sony IMX 586 (48 MP) for it's main sensor and it's Telephoto at 2.2X optical (3X lossless) and is at par with iPhone. But when compared with the GCam Mod, the OnePlus Camera seems to have improved a lot from it's previous versions. The Wide Angle is fairly okayish with some distortions being present at the edges. Nightscape is now available for Wide Angle shots too. ==== Video ==== If you're into Video Recording, then be a bit disappointed to hear this as it isn't the best while it can still take average videos without much shake utilizing the OIS and EIS at 1080P and just OIS at 4K 60FPS. It still doesn't shoot 4K in wide angle. Apple iPhone 11 takes the lead here. OIS and EIS combined together has a lot of warping and rolling shutter which is a turn off for video producers. It's still not an alternate for a Gimbal. The videos look oversaturated too which can be fixed by shooting on a Third Party app like Filmic Pro. ==== Software ==== This is one of the biggest features for you to switch to the OnePlus. Stock Android was butter smooth while I missed out on a lot of simple gestures like Longer Screenshots, Silence Button, Customized Navigational elements & much more which lacked on the Stock OS from Google. I would say Oxygen OS should be set as a benchmark for Google to include these incremental features on their upcoming flagships. Oxygen OS has presently the best OS Experience for Android. ==== Battery ==== Warp T30 is super fast. It helps you charge from 0-100 in lesser time than an episode on Netflix. Although not the fastest charger in the industry, it still gets through a day on heavy usage. ==== What could've been improved ==== - Minor improvements on Camera. - No ToF sensor - No Wireless Charging. - IP Rating. - Better silicon case should be included in their future upgrades. ==== Verdict ==== No doubt that the ASUS Fans would recommend the ROG 2. ROG 2 is hands down the best gaming phone with 120 HZ Display but lacks majorly on other aspects like software updates, Telephoto Camera, Splash Proof, Build Quality and security patches which are very essential for business professionals or regular consumers. ASUS is also not known to provide regular updates to it's consumers over the OnePlus which has a closely knit community among the developers and has more Brand Value than ASUS & nevertheless to mention that the OnePlus 7T Pro feels premium out of the box. If you're planning to upgrade from a device almost 2 years old then this would be the best upgrade in case you require a phone with no-notch and curved screen. 7T Pro feels very slippery when compared to the 7T. I wish they made smaller devices. Otherwise I would still recommend the 7T which is the best bang for your buck. If you still wish to own this but cannot afford the extra rupee on incremental updates (Fast Charging, 855 Plus) , my suggestion would be is to go for the OnePlus 7 Pro. It's still one of the best devices out there.","16 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713enCot+3L._SY88.jpg

"The Best Smartphone of 2019 | The Flagship King","==== A lengthy & brutally honest review. It's worth the read if you plan on purchasing this device. ==== I am a Design Specialist by Profession & also into Mobile Photography, hence I was hooked in using the Pixel 2XL. This phone is a worthy upgrade if you're transitioning from Galaxy S9 / Pixel 1 or 2 series / OnePlus 6, 6T & below / iPhone X or 7 and below. OnePlus 7T Pro is only an incremental upgrade over it's predecessor OnePlus 7 Pro. ===== What has been improved over the 7 Pro? ==== + Faster Processor. Snapdragon 855 Plus. + Adreno 640. Better Gaming Performance. + Better Haptic Motor. Same as the 7T. + Fast Charging. Warp 30T Technology. + Brighter Nits (Upto 1000 compared to 800 of 7 Pro) + Super Macro Mode, Night reading Modes, Android 10 out of the box, Better Nightscape 2.0. These software updates will be eventually updated for the 7 Pro as well. ==== What's in the Box? ==== OnePlus 7T Pro Device. User Manual. Transparent Silicon Case. SIM Ejector Tool. Warp 30T Charging Brick. Type C USB Cable. And some cool OnePlus Stickers. ==== Display ==== Firstly, OnePlus 7T Pro has a stunning display over its predecessors. I'm personally not a fan of notches nor do I click a lot of selfies, so I prefer the OnePlus 7T Pro's Fluid Display. Feels more luxurious over the 7T. It's marginally bigger to hold as well. I would recommend using a case so that the edges don't feel slippery. However, you should also note that in different lighting conditions, 7T Pro has glares at the curves due to the rounder corners which I believe is negligible. 90Hz is smoooooth. You would never want to get back to 60Hz once you're used to this. ==== Performance ==== Snapdragon 855 Plus is one of the best CPUs out there (at the time of writing this review) and with Adrena 640, it takes gaming and multi-tasking to another league. COD & PUB-G juices out at their best with 60FPS & is indeed smooth than imagined. 855 Plus is at par with the A13 Bionic from Apple. Haven't experienced any drops in frames. RAM Management is splendid & 8GB RAM is recommended unless you want to get the 12 Gig McLaren Edition to save on a few seconds everyday. ==== Camera ==== I honestly have to admit that it's not the best out there as I was expecting a leap from it's predecessors. It still uses the Sony IMX 586 (48 MP) for it's main sensor and it's Telephoto at 2.2X optical (3X lossless) and is at par with iPhone. But when compared with the GCam Mod, the OnePlus Camera seems to have improved a lot from it's previous versions. The Wide Angle is fairly okayish with some distortions being present at the edges. Nightscape is now available for Wide Angle shots too. ==== Video ==== If you're into Video Recording, then be a bit disappointed to hear this as it isn't the best while it can still take average videos without much shake utilizing the OIS and EIS at 1080P and just OIS at 4K 60FPS. It still doesn't shoot 4K in wide angle. Apple iPhone 11 takes the lead here. OIS and EIS combined together has a lot of warping and rolling shutter which is a turn off for video producers. It's still not an alternate for a Gimbal. The videos look oversaturated too which can be fixed by shooting on a Third Party app like Filmic Pro. ==== Software ==== This is one of the biggest features for you to switch to the OnePlus. Stock Android was butter smooth while I missed out on a lot of simple gestures like Longer Screenshots, Silence Button, Customized Navigational elements & much more which lacked on the Stock OS from Google. I would say Oxygen OS should be set as a benchmark for Google to include these incremental features on their upcoming flagships. Oxygen OS has presently the best OS Experience for Android. ==== Battery ==== Warp T30 is super fast. It helps you charge from 0-100 in lesser time than an episode on Netflix. Although not the fastest charger in the industry, it still gets through a day on heavy usage. ==== What could've been improved ==== - Minor improvements on Camera. - No ToF sensor - No Wireless Charging. - IP Rating. - Better silicon case should be included in their future upgrades. ==== Verdict ==== No doubt that the ASUS Fans would recommend the ROG 2. ROG 2 is hands down the best gaming phone with 120 HZ Display but lacks majorly on other aspects like software updates, Telephoto Camera, Splash Proof, Build Quality and security patches which are very essential for business professionals or regular consumers. ASUS is also not known to provide regular updates to it's consumers over the OnePlus which has a closely knit community among the developers and has more Brand Value than ASUS & nevertheless to mention that the OnePlus 7T Pro feels premium out of the box. If you're planning to upgrade from a device almost 2 years old then this would be the best upgrade in case you require a phone with no-notch and curved screen. 7T Pro feels very slippery when compared to the 7T. I wish they made smaller devices. Otherwise I would still recommend the 7T which is the best bang for your buck. If you still wish to own this but cannot afford the extra rupee on incremental updates (Fast Charging, 855 Plus) , my suggestion would be is to go for the OnePlus 7 Pro. It's still one of the best devices out there.","16 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713enCot+3L._SY88.jpg

"Its a complete Beast !!! Awesome mobile","I think I am the first one to write a review for this beauty :)  I ordered this at 11 PM in the night and It was there in my hand in the morning 9 AM. I have used iPhone X, Samsung s9 plus and Samsung s10 plus before coming to One Plus 7T.  My experience so far with this: 1. Display: It's amazing. Sharpness, brightness and 90Hz displays makes it one of the most beautiful displays. 2. Camera: All of my previous mobiles had great cameras. 7t Pro is nothing less than that. If you are a professional photographer, you might find differences. For a normal user, it's just perfect. 3. Battery: I am getting a very good battery backup. When I go to bed, it's 30%. 30T Warp charger is a booom. 4. Performance: Blazing and Lightning fast. 5. One of the USP of OnePlus mobiles is its Oxygen OS. After using iPhone and Samsungs One UI, I can tell you that it's the best. Lots of gestures, shortcuts and very lightweight. The only Con I think it has is its weight. It's on the heavier side but after using it for few days now, I am getting used to it. Go for it guys !! You won't regret.","15 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","True","BunnyDecoder","5.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"Kindly Update the Camera Quality with next software updates","Hi, When I open my this most awaited phone, I just saw 2 major Draw Back 1st. The Camera Quality, Dear One Plus maker if we paid you 54000.00 (53999.00) then why we compromise with today's main features the CAMERA. The zoom quality is very poor, pic are RIP-UP,DURING ZOOM SHOT OR WHEN YOU SEE THE CAPTURED IMAGE WITH ZOOM. NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY AND SHOT IS ALSO POOR IN NIGHT PICTURES YOU SAW LOTS OF DOTS- RIP-UP. IMAGE NOT CAPTURED IN HIS ORIGINAL COLOR. THERE ARE LOTS OF ISSUES WITH CAMERA QUALITY. SO THINK ABOUT YOUR USERS AND GIVE A BEST QUALITY.

"Perfect combination of OnePlus 7T and 7Pro","Amazing phone with an unbelievably smooth and vivid display. I had been using the OnePlus 5T before and a big fan of OnePlus cameras and OS.But I've always felt the OnePlus display wasn't good enough.This mobile just killed that thought. Highlights: 1)Buttery smooth, fast and bright display -The edge display is just wowwww. You just can't stop admiring it. 2)Excellent camera - The pictures come out so well in all kinds of lighting and modes. *Portrait*- The new zoom mode in portrait is just wow.Looks exactly like DSLR clicks. Macro - I love taking closeup shots of flowers and patterns and with this...you can get as close as 2.5 cms and click amazing shots. Nightscape - This area is a huge upgrade compared to my OnePlus 5t.You get crisp and clear pictures without any noise.The pictures are now to the mark of Pixel mobiles. Popup camera - If you are hesitant or doubtful about popup cameras...I am telling you there is nothing to worry...It is Soo smooth and quick that you never will notice it is a hardware controlled camera.Selfies have never been this better.Bright and sharp shots anytime. Video - Haven't really used much.Will update later 3)Dolby speakers - Excellent sound quality with awesome stereo effect.Once again a huge upgrade over the older models. 4)90 Hz refresh rate - Yes this one gives you a totally different experience when using your mobile.It is clearly faster and better than the usual 60Hz displays. 5)Build and design - Just perfect...It's sleek...stylish and neat. Loved the camera setup in OnePlus 7T but hated the circular bump.And I totally loved the edge display in OnePlus 7 pro.This device is just a perfect combination of the best features in the 7t and the 7pro and NOT an unwanted model like everyone is claiming. 6) Batter and charging - The charging is blazing fast and the battery very easily lasts a whole day,even with 90Hz refresh rate.","17 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-GmUVthbL._SY88.jpg

The phone is really big and has lot of power in it, no problem in playing games, its like silk smooth games, navigation between apps, super fast. All updates were done for software and apps. I am in love with it.... But After 2 days of normal usage and random navigation on the device. The device started rebooting itself, I was shocked but thought maybe just after reboot it will ok. But it rebooted for 3 hours continuously without any stop, till the whole battery got drained. I was not able to perform any action, it made me handicapped for 3 hours, where I cannot do anything...

Loved the camera setup in OnePlus 7T but hated the circular bump.And I totally loved the edge display in OnePlus 7 pro.This device is just a perfect combination of the best features in the 7t and the 7pro and NOT an unwanted model like everyone is claiming. 6) Batter and charging - The charging is blazing fast and the battery very easily lasts a whole day,even with 90Hz refresh rate.","17 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-GmUVthbL._SY88.jpg

"The Best Smartphone of 2019 | The Flagship King","==== A lengthy & brutally honest review. It's worth the read if you plan on purchasing this device. ==== I am a Design Specialist by Profession & also into Mobile Photography, hence I was hooked in using the Pixel 2XL. This phone is a worthy upgrade if you're transitioning from Galaxy S9 / Pixel 1 or 2 series / OnePlus 6, 6T & below / iPhone X or 7 and below. OnePlus 7T Pro is only an incremental upgrade over it's predecessor OnePlus 7 Pro. ===== What has been improved over the 7 Pro? ==== + Faster Processor. Snapdragon 855 Plus. + Adreno 640. Better Gaming Performance. + Better Haptic Motor. Same as the 7T. + Fast Charging. Warp 30T Technology. + Brighter Nits (Upto 1000 compared to 800 of 7 Pro) + Super Macro Mode, Night reading Modes, Android 10 out of the box, Better Nightscape 2.0. These software updates will be eventually updated for the 7 Pro as well. ==== What's in the Box? ==== OnePlus 7T Pro Device. User Manual. Transparent Silicon Case. SIM Ejector Tool. Warp 30T Charging Brick. Type C USB Cable. And some cool OnePlus Stickers. ==== Display ==== Firstly, OnePlus 7T Pro has a stunning display over its predecessors. I'm personally not a fan of notches nor do I click a lot of selfies, so I prefer the OnePlus 7T Pro's Fluid Display. Feels more luxurious over the 7T. It's marginally bigger to hold as well. I would recommend using a case so that the edges don't feel slippery. However, you should also note that in different lighting conditions, 7T Pro has glares at the curves due to the rounder corners which I believe is negligible. 90Hz is smoooooth. You would never want to get back to 60Hz once you're used to this. ==== Performance ==== Snapdragon 855 Plus is one of the best CPUs out there (at the time of writing this review) and with Adrena 640, it takes gaming and multi-tasking to another league. COD & PUB-G juices out at their best with 60FPS & is indeed smooth than imagined. 855 Plus is at par with the A13 Bionic from Apple. Haven't experienced any drops in frames. RAM Management is splendid & 8GB RAM is recommended unless you want to get the 12 Gig McLaren Edition to save on a few seconds everyday. ==== Camera ==== I honestly have to admit that it's not the best out there as I was expecting a leap from it's predecessors. It still uses the Sony IMX 586 (48 MP) for it's main sensor and it's Telephoto at 2.2X optical (3X lossless) and is at par with iPhone. But when compared with the GCam Mod, the OnePlus Camera seems to have improved a lot from it's previous versions. The Wide Angle is fairly okayish with some distortions being present at the edges. Nightscape is now available for Wide Angle shots too. ==== Video ==== If you're into Video Recording, then be a bit disappointed to hear this as it isn't the best while it can still take average videos without much shake utilizing the OIS and EIS at 1080P and just OIS at 4K 60FPS. It still doesn't shoot 4K in wide angle. Apple iPhone 11 takes the lead here. OIS and EIS combined together has a lot of warping and rolling shutter which is a turn off for video producers. It's still not an alternate for a Gimbal. The videos look oversaturated too which can be fixed by shooting on a Third Party app like Filmic Pro. ==== Software ==== This is one of the biggest features for you to switch to the OnePlus. Stock Android was butter smooth while I missed out on a lot of simple gestures like Longer Screenshots, Silence Button, Customized Navigational elements & much more which lacked on the Stock OS from Google. I would say Oxygen OS should be set as a benchmark for Google to include these incremental features on their upcoming flagships. Oxygen OS has presently the best OS Experience for Android. ==== Battery ==== Warp T30 is super fast. It helps you charge from 0-100 in lesser time than an episode on Netflix. Although not the fastest charger in the industry, it still gets through a day on heavy usage. ==== What could've been improved ==== - Minor improvements on Camera. - No ToF sensor - No Wireless Charging. - IP Rating. - Better silicon case should be included in their future upgrades. ==== Verdict ==== No doubt that the ASUS Fans would recommend the ROG 2. ROG 2 is hands down the best gaming phone with 120 HZ Display but lacks majorly on other aspects like software updates, Telephoto Camera, Splash Proof, Build Quality and security patches which are very essential for business professionals or regular consumers. ASUS is also not known to provide regular updates to it's consumers over the OnePlus which has a closely knit community among the developers and has more Brand Value than ASUS & nevertheless to mention that the OnePlus 7T Pro feels premium out of the box. If you're planning to upgrade from a device almost 2 years old then this would be the best upgrade in case you require a phone with no-notch and curved screen. 7T Pro feels very slippery when compared to the 7T. I wish they made smaller devices. Otherwise I would still recommend the 7T which is the best bang for your buck. If you still wish to own this but cannot afford the extra rupee on incremental updates (Fast Charging, 855 Plus) , my suggestion would be is to go for the OnePlus 7 Pro. It's still one of the best devices out there.","16 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713enCot+3L._SY88.jpg

"Its a complete Beast !!! Awesome mobile","I think I am the first one to write a review for this beauty :)  I ordered this at 11 PM in the night and It was there in my hand in the morning 9 AM. I have used iPhone X, Samsung s9 plus and Samsung s10 plus before coming to One Plus 7T.  My experience so far with this: 1. Display: It's amazing. Sharpness, brightness and 90Hz displays makes it one of the most beautiful displays. 2. Camera: All of my previous mobiles had great cameras. 7t Pro is nothing less than that. If you are a professional photographer, you might find differences. For a normal user, it's just perfect. 3. Battery: I am getting a very good battery backup. When I go to bed, it's 30%. 30T Warp charger is a booom. 4. Performance: Blazing and Lightning fast. 5. One of the USP of OnePlus mobiles is its Oxygen OS. After using iPhone and Samsungs One UI, I can tell you that it's the best. Lots of gestures, shortcuts and very lightweight. The only Con I think it has is its weight. It's on the heavier side but after using it for few days now, I am getting used to it. Go for it guys !! You won't regret.","15 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","True","BunnyDecoder","5.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"Kindly Update the Camera Quality with next software updates","Hi, When I open my this most awaited phone, I just saw 2 major Draw Back 1st. The Camera Quality, Dear One Plus maker if we paid you 54000.00 (53999.00) then why we compromise with today's main features the CAMERA. The zoom quality is very poor, pic are RIP-UP,DURING ZOOM SHOT OR WHEN YOU SEE THE CAPTURED IMAGE WITH ZOOM. NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY AND SHOT IS ALSO POOR IN NIGHT PICTURES YOU SAW LOTS OF DOTS- RIP-UP. IMAGE NOT CAPTURED IN HIS ORIGINAL COLOR. THERE ARE LOTS OF ISSUES WITH CAMERA QUALITY. SO THINK ABOUT YOUR USERS AND GIVE A BEST QUALITY. Hope ONE PLUS Team look and work on it and solve this issue in his next software updates. Dear Amazon team pass this feedback to ONE PLUS TEAM.","22 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","True","@bhi","1.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"Perfect combination of OnePlus 7T and 7Pro","Amazing phone with an unbelievably smooth and vivid display. I had been using the OnePlus 5T before and a big fan of OnePlus cameras and OS.But I've always felt the OnePlus display wasn't good enough.This mobile just killed that thought. Highlights: 1)Buttery smooth, fast and bright display -The edge display is just wowwww. You just can't stop admiring it. 2)Excellent camera - The pictures come out so well in all kinds of lighting and modes. *Portrait*- The new zoom mode in portrait is just wow.Looks exactly like DSLR clicks. Macro - I love taking closeup shots of flowers and patterns and with this...you can get as close as 2.5 cms and click amazing shots. Nightscape - This area is a huge upgrade compared to my OnePlus 5t.You get crisp and clear pictures without any noise.The pictures are now to the mark of Pixel mobiles. Popup camera - If you are hesitant or doubtful about popup cameras...I am telling you there is nothing to worry...It is Soo smooth and quick that you never will notice it is a hardware controlled camera.Selfies have never been this better.Bright and sharp shots anytime. Video - Haven't really used much.Will update later 3)Dolby speakers - Excellent sound quality with awesome stereo effect.Once again a huge upgrade over the older models. 4)90 Hz refresh rate - Yes this one gives you a totally different experience when using your mobile.It is clearly faster and better than the usual 60Hz displays. 5)Build and design - Just perfect...It's sleek...stylish and neat.

"Its a complete Beast !!! Awesome mobile","I think I am the first one to write a review for this beauty :)  I ordered this at 11 PM in the night and It was there in my hand in the morning 9 AM. I have used iPhone X, Samsung s9 plus and Samsung s10 plus before coming to One Plus 7T.  My experience so far with this: 1. Display: It's amazing. Sharpness, brightness and 90Hz displays makes it one of the most beautiful displays. 2. Camera: All of my previous mobiles had great cameras. 7t Pro is nothing less than that. If you are a professional photographer, you might find differences. For a normal user, it's just perfect. 3. Battery: I am getting a very good battery backup. When I go to bed, it's 30%. 30T Warp charger is a booom. 4. Performance: Blazing and Lightning fast. 5. One of the USP of OnePlus mobiles is its Oxygen OS. After using iPhone and Samsungs One UI, I can tell you that it's the best. Lots of gestures, shortcuts and very lightweight. The only Con I think it has is its weight. It's on the heavier side but after using it for few days now, I am getting used to it. Go for it guys !! You won't regret.","15 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","True","BunnyDecoder","5.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"Kindly Update the Camera Quality with next software updates","Hi, When I open my this most awaited phone, I just saw 2 major Draw Back 1st. The Camera Quality, Dear One Plus maker if we paid you 54000.00 (53999.00) then why we compromise with today's main features the CAMERA. The zoom quality is very poor, pic are RIP-UP,DURING ZOOM SHOT OR WHEN YOU SEE THE CAPTURED IMAGE WITH ZOOM. NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY AND SHOT IS ALSO POOR IN NIGHT PICTURES YOU SAW LOTS OF DOTS- RIP-UP. IMAGE NOT CAPTURED IN HIS ORIGINAL COLOR. THERE ARE LOTS OF ISSUES WITH CAMERA QUALITY. SO THINK ABOUT YOUR USERS AND GIVE A BEST QUALITY.

"Perfect combination of OnePlus 7T and 7Pro","Amazing phone with an unbelievably smooth and vivid display. I had been using the OnePlus 5T before and a big fan of OnePlus cameras and OS.But I've always felt the OnePlus display wasn't good enough.This mobile just killed that thought. Highlights: 1)Buttery smooth, fast and bright display -The edge display is just wowwww. You just can't stop admiring it. 2)Excellent camera - The pictures come out so well in all kinds of lighting and modes. *Portrait*- The new zoom mode in portrait is just wow.Looks exactly like DSLR clicks. Macro - I love taking closeup shots of flowers and patterns and with this...you can get as close as 2.5 cms and click amazing shots. Nightscape - This area is a huge upgrade compared to my OnePlus 5t.You get crisp and clear pictures without any noise.The pictures are now to the mark of Pixel mobiles. Popup camera - If you are hesitant or doubtful about popup cameras...I am telling you there is nothing to worry...It is Soo smooth and quick that you never will notice it is a hardware controlled camera.Selfies have never been this better.Bright and sharp shots anytime. Video - Haven't really used much.Will update later 3)Dolby speakers - Excellent sound quality with awesome stereo effect.Once again a huge upgrade over the older models. 4)90 Hz refresh rate - Yes this one gives you a totally different experience when using your mobile.It is clearly faster and better than the usual 60Hz displays. 5)Build and design - Just perfect...It's sleek...stylish and neat. Loved the camera setup in OnePlus 7T but hated the circular bump.And I totally loved the edge display in OnePlus 7 pro.This device is just a perfect combination of the best features in the 7t and the 7pro and NOT an unwanted model like everyone is claiming. 6) Batter and charging - The charging is blazing fast and the battery very easily lasts a whole day,even with 90Hz refresh rate.","17 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-GmUVthbL._SY88.jpg

"The Best Smartphone of 2019 | The Flagship King","==== A lengthy & brutally honest review. It's worth the read if you plan on purchasing this device. ==== I am a Design Specialist by Profession & also into Mobile Photography, hence I was hooked in using the Pixel 2XL. This phone is a worthy upgrade if you're transitioning from Galaxy S9 / Pixel 1 or 2 series / OnePlus 6, 6T & below / iPhone X or 7 and below. OnePlus 7T Pro is only an incremental upgrade over it's predecessor OnePlus 7 Pro. ===== What has been improved over the 7 Pro? ==== + Faster Processor. Snapdragon 855 Plus. + Adreno 640. Better Gaming Performance. + Better Haptic Motor. Same as the 7T. + Fast Charging. Warp 30T Technology. + Brighter Nits (Upto 1000 compared to 800 of 7 Pro) + Super Macro Mode, Night reading Modes, Android 10 out of the box, Better Nightscape 2.0. These software updates will be eventually updated for the 7 Pro as well. ==== What's in the Box? ==== OnePlus 7T Pro Device. User Manual. Transparent Silicon Case. SIM Ejector Tool. Warp 30T Charging Brick. Type C USB Cable. And some cool OnePlus Stickers. ==== Display ==== Firstly, OnePlus 7T Pro has a stunning display over its predecessors. I'm personally not a fan of notches nor do I click a lot of selfies, so I prefer the OnePlus 7T Pro's Fluid Display. Feels more luxurious over the 7T. It's marginally bigger to hold as well. I would recommend using a case so that the edges don't feel slippery. However, you should also note that in different lighting conditions, 7T Pro has glares at the curves due to the rounder corners which I believe is negligible. 90Hz is smoooooth. You would never want to get back to 60Hz once you're used to this. ==== Performance ==== Snapdragon 855 Plus is one of the best CPUs out there (at the time of writing this review) and with Adrena 640, it takes gaming and multi-tasking to another league. COD & PUB-G juices out at their best with 60FPS & is indeed smooth than imagined. 855 Plus is at par with the A13 Bionic from Apple. Haven't experienced any drops in frames. RAM Management is splendid & 8GB RAM is recommended unless you want to get the 12 Gig McLaren Edition to save on a few seconds everyday. ==== Camera ==== I honestly have to admit that it's not the best out there as I was expecting a leap from it's predecessors. It still uses the Sony IMX 586 (48 MP) for it's main sensor and it's Telephoto at 2.2X optical (3X lossless) and is at par with iPhone. But when compared with the GCam Mod, the OnePlus Camera seems to have improved a lot from it's previous versions. The Wide Angle is fairly okayish with some distortions being present at the edges. Nightscape is now available for Wide Angle shots too. ==== Video ==== If you're into Video Recording, then be a bit disappointed to hear this as it isn't the best while it can still take average videos without much shake utilizing the OIS and EIS at 1080P and just OIS at 4K 60FPS. It still doesn't shoot 4K in wide angle. Apple iPhone 11 takes the lead here. OIS and EIS combined together has a lot of warping and rolling shutter which is a turn off for video producers. It's still not an alternate for a Gimbal. The videos look oversaturated too which can be fixed by shooting on a Third Party app like Filmic Pro. ==== Software ==== This is one of the biggest features for you to switch to the OnePlus. Stock Android was butter smooth while I missed out on a lot of simple gestures like Longer Screenshots, Silence Button, Customized Navigational elements & much more which lacked on the Stock OS from Google. I would say Oxygen OS should be set as a benchmark for Google to include these incremental features on their upcoming flagships. Oxygen OS has presently the best OS Experience for Android. ==== Battery ==== Warp T30 is super fast. It helps you charge from 0-100 in lesser time than an episode on Netflix. Although not the fastest charger in the industry, it still gets through a day on heavy usage. ==== What could've been improved ==== - Minor improvements on Camera. - No ToF sensor - No Wireless Charging. - IP Rating. - Better silicon case should be included in their future upgrades. ==== Verdict ==== No doubt that the ASUS Fans would recommend the ROG 2. ROG 2 is hands down the best gaming phone with 120 HZ Display but lacks majorly on other aspects like software updates, Telephoto Camera, Splash Proof, Build Quality and security patches which are very essential for business professionals or regular consumers. ASUS is also not known to provide regular updates to it's consumers over the OnePlus which has a closely knit community among the developers and has more Brand Value than ASUS & nevertheless to mention that the OnePlus 7T Pro feels premium out of the box. If you're planning to upgrade from a device almost 2 years old then this would be the best upgrade in case you require a phone with no-notch and curved screen. 7T Pro feels very slippery when compared to the 7T. I wish they made smaller devices. Otherwise I would still recommend the 7T which is the best bang for your buck. If you still wish to own this but cannot afford the extra rupee on incremental updates (Fast Charging, 855 Plus) , my suggestion would be is to go for the OnePlus 7 Pro. It's still one of the best devices out there.","16 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713enCot+3L._SY88.jpg

"The Best Smartphone of 2019 | The Flagship King","==== A lengthy & brutally honest review. It's worth the read if you plan on purchasing this device. ==== I am a Design Specialist by Profession & also into Mobile Photography, hence I was hooked in using the Pixel 2XL. This phone is a worthy upgrade if you're transitioning from Galaxy S9 / Pixel 1 or 2 series / OnePlus 6, 6T & below / iPhone X or 7 and below. OnePlus 7T Pro is only an incremental upgrade over it's predecessor OnePlus 7 Pro. ===== What has been improved over the 7 Pro? ==== + Faster Processor. Snapdragon 855 Plus. + Adreno 640. Better Gaming Performance. + Better Haptic Motor. Same as the 7T. + Fast Charging. Warp 30T Technology. + Brighter Nits (Upto 1000 compared to 800 of 7 Pro) + Super Macro Mode, Night reading Modes, Android 10 out of the box, Better Nightscape 2.0. These software updates will be eventually updated for the 7 Pro as well. ==== What's in the Box? ==== OnePlus 7T Pro Device. User Manual. Transparent Silicon Case. SIM Ejector Tool. Warp 30T Charging Brick. Type C USB Cable. And some cool OnePlus Stickers. ==== Display ==== Firstly, OnePlus 7T Pro has a stunning display over its predecessors. I'm personally not a fan of notches nor do I click a lot of selfies, so I prefer the OnePlus 7T Pro's Fluid Display. Feels more luxurious over the 7T. It's marginally bigger to hold as well. I would recommend using a case so that the edges don't feel slippery. However, you should also note that in different lighting conditions, 7T Pro has glares at the curves due to the rounder corners which I believe is negligible. 90Hz is smoooooth. You would never want to get back to 60Hz once you're used to this. ==== Performance ==== Snapdragon 855 Plus is one of the best CPUs out there (at the time of writing this review) and with Adrena 640, it takes gaming and multi-tasking to another league. COD & PUB-G juices out at their best with 60FPS & is indeed smooth than imagined. 855 Plus is at par with the A13 Bionic from Apple. Haven't experienced any drops in frames. RAM Management is splendid & 8GB RAM is recommended unless you want to get the 12 Gig McLaren Edition to save on a few seconds everyday. ==== Camera ==== I honestly have to admit that it's not the best out there as I was expecting a leap from it's predecessors. It still uses the Sony IMX 586 (48 MP) for it's main sensor and it's Telephoto at 2.2X optical (3X lossless) and is at par with iPhone. But when compared with the GCam Mod, the OnePlus Camera seems to have improved a lot from it's previous versions. The Wide Angle is fairly okayish with some distortions being present at the edges. Nightscape is now available for Wide Angle shots too. ==== Video ==== If you're into Video Recording, then be a bit disappointed to hear this as it isn't the best while it can still take average videos without much shake utilizing the OIS and EIS at 1080P and just OIS at 4K 60FPS. It still doesn't shoot 4K in wide angle. Apple iPhone 11 takes the lead here. OIS and EIS combined together has a lot of warping and rolling shutter which is a turn off for video producers. It's still not an alternate for a Gimbal. The videos look oversaturated too which can be fixed by shooting on a Third Party app like Filmic Pro. ==== Software ==== This is one of the biggest features for you to switch to the OnePlus. Stock Android was butter smooth while I missed out on a lot of simple gestures like Longer Screenshots, Silence Button, Customized Navigational elements & much more which lacked on the Stock OS from Google. I would say Oxygen OS should be set as a benchmark for Google to include these incremental features on their upcoming flagships. Oxygen OS has presently the best OS Experience for Android. ==== Battery ==== Warp T30 is super fast. It helps you charge from 0-100 in lesser time than an episode on Netflix. Although not the fastest charger in the industry, it still gets through a day on heavy usage. ==== What could've been improved ==== - Minor improvements on Camera. - No ToF sensor - No Wireless Charging. - IP Rating. - Better silicon case should be included in their future upgrades. ==== Verdict ==== No doubt that the ASUS Fans would recommend the ROG 2. ROG 2 is hands down the best gaming phone with 120 HZ Display but lacks majorly on other aspects like software updates, Telephoto Camera, Splash Proof, Build Quality and security patches which are very essential for business professionals or regular consumers. ASUS is also not known to provide regular updates to it's consumers over the OnePlus which has a closely knit community among the developers and has more Brand Value than ASUS & nevertheless to mention that the OnePlus 7T Pro feels premium out of the box. If you're planning to upgrade from a device almost 2 years old then this would be the best upgrade in case you require a phone with no-notch and curved screen. 7T Pro feels very slippery when compared to the 7T. I wish they made smaller devices. Otherwise I would still recommend the 7T which is the best bang for your buck. If you still wish to own this but cannot afford the extra rupee on incremental updates (Fast Charging, 855 Plus) , my suggestion would be is to go for the OnePlus 7 Pro. It's still one of the best devices out there.","16 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713enCot+3L._SY88.jpg

"Its a complete Beast !!! Awesome mobile","I think I am the first one to write a review for this beauty :)  I ordered this at 11 PM in the night and It was there in my hand in the morning 9 AM. I have used iPhone X, Samsung s9 plus and Samsung s10 plus before coming to One Plus 7T.  My experience so far with this: 1. Display: It's amazing. Sharpness, brightness and 90Hz displays makes it one of the most beautiful displays. 2. Camera: All of my previous mobiles had great cameras. 7t Pro is nothing less than that. If you are a professional photographer, you might find differences. For a normal user, it's just perfect. 3. Battery: I am getting a very good battery backup. When I go to bed, it's 30%. 30T Warp charger is a booom. 4. Performance: Blazing and Lightning fast. 5. One of the USP of OnePlus mobiles is its Oxygen OS. After using iPhone and Samsungs One UI, I can tell you that it's the best. Lots of gestures, shortcuts and very lightweight. The only Con I think it has is its weight. It's on the heavier side but after using it for few days now, I am getting used to it. Go for it guys !! You won't regret.","15 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","True","BunnyDecoder","5.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"Kindly Update the Camera Quality with next software updates","Hi, When I open my this most awaited phone, I just saw 2 major Draw Back 1st. The Camera Quality, Dear One Plus maker if we paid you 54000.00 (53999.00) then why we compromise with today's main features the CAMERA. The zoom quality is very poor, pic are RIP-UP,DURING ZOOM SHOT OR WHEN YOU SEE THE CAPTURED IMAGE WITH ZOOM. NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY AND SHOT IS ALSO POOR IN NIGHT PICTURES YOU SAW LOTS OF DOTS- RIP-UP. IMAGE NOT CAPTURED IN HIS ORIGINAL COLOR. THERE ARE LOTS OF ISSUES WITH CAMERA QUALITY. SO THINK ABOUT YOUR USERS AND GIVE A BEST QUALITY.

"Perfect combination of OnePlus 7T and 7Pro","Amazing phone with an unbelievably smooth and vivid display. I had been using the OnePlus 5T before and a big fan of OnePlus cameras and OS.But I've always felt the OnePlus display wasn't good enough.This mobile just killed that thought. Highlights: 1)Buttery smooth, fast and bright display -The edge display is just wowwww. You just can't stop admiring it. 2)Excellent camera - The pictures come out so well in all kinds of lighting and modes. *Portrait*- The new zoom mode in portrait is just wow.Looks exactly like DSLR clicks. Macro - I love taking closeup shots of flowers and patterns and with this...you can get as close as 2.5 cms and click amazing shots. Nightscape - This area is a huge upgrade compared to my OnePlus 5t.You get crisp and clear pictures without any noise.The pictures are now to the mark of Pixel mobiles. Popup camera - If you are hesitant or doubtful about popup cameras...I am telling you there is nothing to worry...It is Soo smooth and quick that you never will notice it is a hardware controlled camera.Selfies have never been this better.Bright and sharp shots anytime. Video - Haven't really used much.Will update later 3)Dolby speakers - Excellent sound quality with awesome stereo effect.Once again a huge upgrade over the older models. 4)90 Hz refresh rate - Yes this one gives you a totally different experience when using your mobile.It is clearly faster and better than the usual 60Hz displays. 5)Build and design - Just perfect...It's sleek...stylish and neat. Loved the camera setup in OnePlus 7T but hated the circular bump.And I totally loved the edge display in OnePlus 7 pro.This device is just a perfect combination of the best features in the 7t and the 7pro and NOT an unwanted model like everyone is claiming. 6) Batter and charging - The charging is blazing fast and the battery very easily lasts a whole day,even with 90Hz refresh rate.","17 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-GmUVthbL._SY88.jpg

The phone is really big and has lot of power in it, no problem in playing games, its like silk smooth games, navigation between apps, super fast. All updates were done for software and apps. I am in love with it.... But After 2 days of normal usage and random navigation on the device. The device started rebooting itself, I was shocked but thought maybe just after reboot it will ok. But it rebooted for 3 hours continuously without any stop, till the whole battery got drained. I was not able to perform any action, it made me handicapped for 3 hours, where I cannot do anything...

"The Best Smartphone of 2019 | The Flagship King","==== A lengthy & brutally honest review. It's worth the read if you plan on purchasing this device. ==== I am a Design Specialist by Profession & also into Mobile Photography, hence I was hooked in using the Pixel 2XL. This phone is a worthy upgrade if you're transitioning from Galaxy S9 / Pixel 1 or 2 series / OnePlus 6, 6T & below / iPhone X or 7 and below. OnePlus 7T Pro is only an incremental upgrade over it's predecessor OnePlus 7 Pro. ===== What has been improved over the 7 Pro? ==== + Faster Processor. Snapdragon 855 Plus. + Adreno 640. Better Gaming Performance. + Better Haptic Motor. Same as the 7T. + Fast Charging. Warp 30T Technology. + Brighter Nits (Upto 1000 compared to 800 of 7 Pro) + Super Macro Mode, Night reading Modes, Android 10 out of the box, Better Nightscape 2.0. These software updates will be eventually updated for the 7 Pro as well. ==== What's in the Box? ==== OnePlus 7T Pro Device. User Manual. Transparent Silicon Case. SIM Ejector Tool. Warp 30T Charging Brick. Type C USB Cable. And some cool OnePlus Stickers. ==== Display ==== Firstly, OnePlus 7T Pro has a stunning display over its predecessors. I'm personally not a fan of notches nor do I click a lot of selfies, so I prefer the OnePlus 7T Pro's Fluid Display. Feels more luxurious over the 7T. It's marginally bigger to hold as well. I would recommend using a case so that the edges don't feel slippery. However, you should also note that in different lighting conditions, 7T Pro has glares at the curves due to the rounder corners which I believe is negligible. 90Hz is smoooooth. You would never want to get back to 60Hz once you're used to this. ==== Performance ==== Snapdragon 855 Plus is one of the best CPUs out there (at the time of writing this review) and with Adrena 640, it takes gaming and multi-tasking to another league. COD & PUB-G juices out at their best with 60FPS & is indeed smooth than imagined. 855 Plus is at par with the A13 Bionic from Apple. Haven't experienced any drops in frames. RAM Management is splendid & 8GB RAM is recommended unless you want to get the 12 Gig McLaren Edition to save on a few seconds everyday. ==== Camera ==== I honestly have to admit that it's not the best out there as I was expecting a leap from it's predecessors. It still uses the Sony IMX 586 (48 MP) for it's main sensor and it's Telephoto at 2.2X optical (3X lossless) and is at par with iPhone. But when compared with the GCam Mod, the OnePlus Camera seems to have improved a lot from it's previous versions. The Wide Angle is fairly okayish with some distortions being present at the edges. Nightscape is now available for Wide Angle shots too. ==== Video ==== If you're into Video Recording, then be a bit disappointed to hear this as it isn't the best while it can still take average videos without much shake utilizing the OIS and EIS at 1080P and just OIS at 4K 60FPS. It still doesn't shoot 4K in wide angle. Apple iPhone 11 takes the lead here. OIS and EIS combined together has a lot of warping and rolling shutter which is a turn off for video producers. It's still not an alternate for a Gimbal. The videos look oversaturated too which can be fixed by shooting on a Third Party app like Filmic Pro. ==== Software ==== This is one of the biggest features for you to switch to the OnePlus. Stock Android was butter smooth while I missed out on a lot of simple gestures like Longer Screenshots, Silence Button, Customized Navigational elements & much more which lacked on the Stock OS from Google. I would say Oxygen OS should be set as a benchmark for Google to include these incremental features on their upcoming flagships. Oxygen OS has presently the best OS Experience for Android. ==== Battery ==== Warp T30 is super fast. It helps you charge from 0-100 in lesser time than an episode on Netflix. Although not the fastest charger in the industry, it still gets through a day on heavy usage. ==== What could've been improved ==== - Minor improvements on Camera. - No ToF sensor - No Wireless Charging. - IP Rating. - Better silicon case should be included in their future upgrades. ==== Verdict ==== No doubt that the ASUS Fans would recommend the ROG 2. ROG 2 is hands down the best gaming phone with 120 HZ Display but lacks majorly on other aspects like software updates, Telephoto Camera, Splash Proof, Build Quality and security patches which are very essential for business professionals or regular consumers. ASUS is also not known to provide regular updates to it's consumers over the OnePlus which has a closely knit community among the developers and has more Brand Value than ASUS & nevertheless to mention that the OnePlus 7T Pro feels premium out of the box. If you're planning to upgrade from a device almost 2 years old then this would be the best upgrade in case you require a phone with no-notch and curved screen. 7T Pro feels very slippery when compared to the 7T. I wish they made smaller devices. Otherwise I would still recommend the 7T which is the best bang for your buck. If you still wish to own this but cannot afford the extra rupee on incremental updates (Fast Charging, 855 Plus) , my suggestion would be is to go for the OnePlus 7 Pro. It's still one of the best devices out there.","16 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713enCot+3L._SY88.jpg

"Its a complete Beast !!! Awesome mobile","I think I am the first one to write a review for this beauty :)  I ordered this at 11 PM in the night and It was there in my hand in the morning 9 AM. I have used iPhone X, Samsung s9 plus and Samsung s10 plus before coming to One Plus 7T.  My experience so far with this: 1. Display: It's amazing. Sharpness, brightness and 90Hz displays makes it one of the most beautiful displays. 2. Camera: All of my previous mobiles had great cameras. 7t Pro is nothing less than that. If you are a professional photographer, you might find differences. For a normal user, it's just perfect. 3. Battery: I am getting a very good battery backup. When I go to bed, it's 30%. 30T Warp charger is a booom. 4. Performance: Blazing and Lightning fast. 5. One of the USP of OnePlus mobiles is its Oxygen OS. After using iPhone and Samsungs One UI, I can tell you that it's the best. Lots of gestures, shortcuts and very lightweight. The only Con I think it has is its weight. It's on the heavier side but after using it for few days now, I am getting used to it. Go for it guys !! You won't regret.","15 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","True","BunnyDecoder","5.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"Kindly Update the Camera Quality with next software updates","Hi, When I open my this most awaited phone, I just saw 2 major Draw Back 1st. The Camera Quality, Dear One Plus maker if we paid you 54000.00 (53999.00) then why we compromise with today's main features the CAMERA. The zoom quality is very poor, pic are RIP-UP,DURING ZOOM SHOT OR WHEN YOU SEE THE CAPTURED IMAGE WITH ZOOM. NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY AND SHOT IS ALSO POOR IN NIGHT PICTURES YOU SAW LOTS OF DOTS- RIP-UP. IMAGE NOT CAPTURED IN HIS ORIGINAL COLOR. THERE ARE LOTS OF ISSUES WITH CAMERA QUALITY. SO THINK ABOUT YOUR USERS AND GIVE A BEST QUALITY. Hope ONE PLUS Team look and work on it and solve this issue in his next software updates. Dear Amazon team pass this feedback to ONE PLUS TEAM.","22 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","True","@bhi","1.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"Perfect combination of OnePlus 7T and 7Pro","Amazing phone with an unbelievably smooth and vivid display. I had been using the OnePlus 5T before and a big fan of OnePlus cameras and OS.But I've always felt the OnePlus display wasn't good enough.This mobile just killed that thought. Highlights: 1)Buttery smooth, fast and bright display -The edge display is just wowwww. You just can't stop admiring it. 2)Excellent camera - The pictures come out so well in all kinds of lighting and modes. *Portrait*- The new zoom mode in portrait is just wow.Looks exactly like DSLR clicks. Macro - I love taking closeup shots of flowers and patterns and with this...you can get as close as 2.5 cms and click amazing shots. Nightscape - This area is a huge upgrade compared to my OnePlus 5t.You get crisp and clear pictures without any noise.The pictures are now to the mark of Pixel mobiles. Popup camera - If you are hesitant or doubtful about popup cameras...I am telling you there is nothing to worry...It is Soo smooth and quick that you never will notice it is a hardware controlled camera.Selfies have never been this better.Bright and sharp shots anytime. Video - Haven't really used much.Will update later 3)Dolby speakers - Excellent sound quality with awesome stereo effect.Once again a huge upgrade over the older models. 4)90 Hz refresh rate - Yes this one gives you a totally different experience when using your mobile.It is clearly faster and better than the usual 60Hz displays. 5)Build and design - Just perfect...It's sleek...stylish and neat. Loved the camera setup in OnePlus 7T but hated the circular bump.And I totally loved the edge display in OnePlus 7 pro.This device is just a perfect combination of the best features in the 7t and the 7pro and NOT an unwanted model like everyone is claiming. 6) Batter and charging - The charging is blazing fast and the battery very easily lasts a whole day,even with 90Hz refresh rate.","17 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-GmUVthbL._SY88.jpg

If you are a professional photographer, you might find differences. For a normal user, it's just perfect. 3. Battery: I am getting a very good battery backup. When I go to bed, it's 30%. 30T Warp charger is a booom. 4. Performance: Blazing and Lightning fast. 5. One of the USP of OnePlus mobiles is its Oxygen OS. After using iPhone and Samsungs One UI, I can tell you that it's the best. Lots of gestures, shortcuts and very lightweight. The only Con I think it has is its weight. It's on the heavier side but after using it for few days now, I am getting used to it. Go for it guys !! You won't regret.","15 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","True","BunnyDecoder","5.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"Kindly Update the Camera Quality with next software updates","Hi, When I open my this most awaited phone, I just saw 2 major Draw Back 1st. The Camera Quality, Dear One Plus maker if we paid you 54000.00 (53999.00) then why we compromise with today's main features the CAMERA. The zoom quality is very poor, pic are RIP-UP,DURING ZOOM SHOT OR WHEN YOU SEE THE CAPTURED IMAGE WITH ZOOM. NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY AND SHOT IS ALSO POOR IN NIGHT PICTURES YOU SAW LOTS OF DOTS- RIP-UP. IMAGE NOT CAPTURED IN HIS ORIGINAL COLOR. THERE ARE LOTS OF ISSUES WITH CAMERA QUALITY. SO THINK ABOUT YOUR USERS AND GIVE A BEST QUALITY. Hope ONE PLUS Team look and work on it and solve this issue in his next software updates. Dear Amazon team pass this feedback to ONE PLUS TEAM.","22 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","True","@bhi","1.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"Perfect combination of OnePlus 7T and 7Pro","Amazing phone with an unbelievably smooth and vivid display. I had been using the OnePlus 5T before and a big fan of OnePlus cameras and OS.But I've always felt the OnePlus display wasn't good enough.This mobile just killed that thought. Highlights: 1)Buttery smooth, fast and bright display -The edge display is just wowwww. You just can't stop admiring it. 2)Excellent camera - The pictures come out so well in all kinds of lighting and modes. *Portrait*- The new zoom mode in portrait is just wow.Looks exactly like DSLR clicks. Macro - I love taking closeup shots of flowers and patterns and with this...you can get as close as 2.5 cms and click amazing shots. Nightscape - This area is a huge upgrade compared to my OnePlus 5t.You get crisp and clear pictures without any noise.The pictures are now to the mark of Pixel mobiles. Popup camera - If you are hesitant or doubtful about popup cameras...I am telling you there is nothing to worry...It is Soo smooth and quick that you never will notice it is a hardware controlled camera.Selfies have never been this better.Bright and sharp shots anytime. Video - Haven't really used much.Will update later 3)Dolby speakers - Excellent sound quality with awesome stereo effect.Once again a huge upgrade over the older models. 4)90 Hz refresh rate - Yes this one gives you a totally different experience when using your mobile.It is clearly faster and better than the usual 60Hz displays. 5)Build and design - Just perfect...It's sleek...stylish and neat. Loved the camera setup in OnePlus 7T but hated the circular bump.And I totally loved the edge display in OnePlus 7 pro.This device is just a perfect combination of the best features in the 7t and the 7pro and NOT an unwanted model like everyone is claiming. 6) Batter and charging - The charging is blazing fast and the battery very easily lasts a whole day,even with 90Hz refresh rate.","17 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-GmUVthbL._SY88.jpg

"Buy at your RISK...!!!","I was really happy to have this phone, switching from apple to android. The phone is really big and has lot of power in it, no problem in playing games, its like silk smooth games, navigation between apps, super fast. All updates were done for software and apps. I am in love with it.... But After 2 days of normal usage and random navigation on the device. The device started rebooting itself, I was shocked but thought maybe just after reboot it will ok. But it rebooted for 3 hours continuously without any stop, till the whole battery got drained. I was not able to perform any action, it made me handicapped for 3 hours, where I cannot do anything... Check the video Finally, I am returning it after long conversation with Amazon support and the OnePlus team.

"No 3.5 jack and overpriced.","No 3.5 headphone jack(Phone is thicker than 3.5 and there's plenty of space). No 3.5/C adapter provided in box. Never settle? No official adapter sold in Amazon either. You have to get registered on their website. Why?! Display seems to have a bit of yellow tint. Although fast, not really seeing the so called magic of 90Hz display. Overhyped. Curved edges make reading a bit weird: Lines go up from the left (curve on the left), then flat in the middle and then go down on the right(curve on the right)- Wish the OS provided a margin on both edges,if needed.","18 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","True","AmazonCustomer","1.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"Great but always with some screen and body issues!","I changed OnePlus 8, 4 times! Due to something or the other defects (like headache giving screens, line marks at the back of the body, etc) as it's expensive! Phone boxes were puffed, torned, some displays were dull if noticed closely, more warm and yellowish. No control by OnePlus on this. People go nuts like ""wow what a display"" not realizing that they are being given inferior quality displays of Samsung. I hope I really hope people strive for perfection to really understand and get what they are paying for by controlling their excitements a bit and forward stronger feedbacks, as I believe I was listened and Amazon India did helped me too. My 5th device came altogether from a different location, excellent box, phone built and display feels more broader even with same dimensions, no two parallel lines design or defect at the back, it's clean and curvy like OnePlus 8 8gb variant (mine is the 6gb one). Screen display is still more warm which I didn't want but colors are very punchy and clearly shows the display is far better than previous returned devices. 1st OnePlus 8 8gb - Had a very long permanent line mark at the back of the body if looked closely. 2nd OnePlus 8 8gb - Display's blue light filter had issues I'm sure as it gave me headache in seconds, eye strain as well. 3rd OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines on edges of the back body if the device was tilted a little, was like a dent kind of design or defect (I believe though this one had the best display even than the 5th one that I'm keeping and more smoother 90 HZ). 4th OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines were again there so I thought it's normal and was okay with it, but display was yellowish and dull, playing pubg with graphics optimization made the game look more ugly in extreme hd settings (hdr sucks). Looking at Images on articles, etc were looking just good. 5th OnePlus 8 6gb variant - As told above there are no 2 parallel lines, punchy colors, not dull and very good display, however still yellowish in large part of the screen and whitish around above and right & left edges of the screen in vivid mode (I did noticed in some displays it was not this warm). I also noticed vivid mode was nicer and whiter in previous devices than this one whether they were dull or not. I also know screen being yellowish a bit makes video viewing an amazing experience to make it more natural for skin color, etc. But should be less and corrected with all the flaws mentioned. However, I'm tierd and somewhat satisfied but will want OnePlus to correct if possible with software update without compromising any quality of the display. It's said that Apple never compromises on quality, they even delay their production if they find any imperfections (I don't like iOS or use Apple though).  OnePlus should do like this. Not happy at all with this kind of support. I noticed paying more (when I got the 8gb one) was really like getting better qalutiy made device (the first one, if the issue mentioned wasn't there). This shouldn't be the case as this leads to disappointment and all variants should be given the same attention/perfection with just internal hardware changes. OnePlus 8 will be my first and last device for a short period of time. Will look for a brand who cares. 3 out of 5.","27 Jun 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61J0cwf2PaL._SY88.jpg

"Delivers what they promised.! ;)","Great phone! Gaming performance is so great, device don't get heat up at all even at high settings! I played PUBG Mobile and details it provides were so exciting and make it feel real. Shadows of tree,stones, mud, etc. If you have small hands don't buy it for gaming, don't feel comfortable with small hands. Camera is good, can't say it is awesome! Battery life is great too, charge too fast! UI is as expected stock android, some pre-installed third party apps were also installed, you can uninstall all of them except Netflix. The back cover they provide is loose and cheap. Have to buy a new better one! Over all a great phone!

"Better phone but could have been the best","Great phone, Amazon delivers it within 10 hours of ordering really happy there, Pros: Beast performance Great battery Life Brilliant Screen Fluid 90hz And blazing fast oxygen os 5g Cons: Camera: have a 2megapixel camera for the sake of having 3 camera on the back Rest of the camera are only average Hopefully upadates can fix that and given one plus history I think they will! Curved screen cause accidental touches and most covers can't cover phone fully in the front due to display Hence its prone to break more than regular flat screen phone like 7t Have a little bit of weight due to larger battery Princing is highly agressive but could have provided wireless charging and headphone jack In the same price! Overall good phone if you want a future proof phone but this eyes closed But if you are on a budget 7t can mostly get you there with better camera and almost as fast snapdragon 855plus Choose wisely","16 Jun 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","True","Sahil bansal","5.0","OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-547/product-reviews/B078BNQ318/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"Do NOT buy this expecting a stellar camera","Obviously, you might have done extensive research, watched many review videos before coming here to make your purchase decision. There is only one way you will be happy with this purchase and that is, if you are looking for a slim, elegant, powerful, light weight device offering a premium in-hand feel. Day to day, if this is what is most important to you, then this is the device to get. Camera is going to serve you well on many occasions (when the lighting is good). People might have told you that the camera system is mediocre. That is not entirely true. There have been few software updates and I can confidently say that yes, the camera is neither great nor is it bad. It delivers decent pictures (when the lighting is good) and if you are not a absolute camera geek, then this will meet and succeed all of your expectations. Incase you are a camera geek, then get the 8Pro and dont think about saving money. Conclusion: Feels expensive and has a nice balance in the hand (Its very light and is a joy to use). The glacial green in matte finish is makes the front of the device look expensive (with the dark edge-to-edge AMOLED panel). It performs like it should. It has an QC 865 after all! It will easily get you through more than a day with a full charge. Its a very low risk decision. Cant go wrong - Just buy the damn thing!","18 Jun 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41e3+yQVw2L._SY88.jpg","True","SK","5.0","OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-547/product-reviews/B078BNQ318/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"best and most reliable phone at this price","I am writing this review after using this phone for 7 days. I believe real user reviews are more useful than Youtube tech reviews which are highly biased and not practical. I bought the 6 GB variant which is available at 42k. Don't go for 8 GB variant and spend 3k more of your valuable money. For normal users, 6 GB RAM is more than sufficient. 2 GB RAM doesn't make your phone fast, it's the processor that does that work. At 42k price, this is the best option available right now. I would rate it 4.5/5. 1. Design: It is an amazing, premium looking phone. Glass back feels awesome. weight management and dimensions are also great. The curved display looks amazing. 2. Display: Display is bright and visible in direct sunlight. At the lowest brightness level, I did not notice any flickering. In Natural mode, I noticed some yellowish color, it is some software issue or it is like that only. I changed to Advanced>AMOLED wide gamut, now it works perfectly. The curved display doesn't make any difference after 1 or 2 days and it comes with ""fragile tag"" so be prepared to take extra care of it. 90hz really makes the difference over 60hz. Once you use 90hz display, going back to 60Hz would feel like the phone is lagging. 3. Performance: It is a snapdragon 865. Performance is buttery smooth. 4. Software: This is my first oneplus phone. Coming from Motorola phone, my first priority was a stock android experience. OxygenOS is best android UI right, stock android experience with all required customization. Oneplus also provide timely and long term software updates to its phones which is the very good thing. 5. Battery: I was using my phone at 90Hz all the time with all animations on. You would easily get whole day of battery life even if you are moderate to heavy user. For initial 1-2 charging cycles. I was getting around 6 hours of SOT which improved to 7-7.30 hr of SOT. Charging speed is also great, it would charge from 10 to 95% in around 50 mins. 6. Call quality and in other day to day usage, I haven't find any issues yet. Speakers are also very loud and clear. 7. Camera: here comes the one and an only area which I didn't like. Primary camera and ultrawide angle camera is good but not any improvement over 7T. and 2 MP macro camera is really pathetic and useless. I also facing some issue in front camera. Low light photos are blurry and during video calls, it zooms the face and produces blurry face. i hope Oneplus gives software updates and solves all camera problems. I found a solution for myself by downloading Gcam which is giving better results but still for 42k phone, camera is not that good. Conclusion: No phone is perfect. This has issues in camera department. but I believe other than that this phone is great, go for it. When You spend more than 35-40K, always go for brand value like Oneplus, Samsung, Apple. I hope you find this review useful. I Will update if I find any issue in the future.","21 Jun 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","True","Vikas Shah","5.0","OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-547/product-reviews/B078BNQ318/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

I also noticed vivid mode was nicer and whiter in previous devices than this one whether they were dull or not. I also know screen being yellowish a bit makes video viewing an amazing experience to make it more natural for skin color, etc. But should be less and corrected with all the flaws mentioned. However, I'm tierd and somewhat satisfied but will want OnePlus to correct if possible with software update without compromising any quality of the display. It's said that Apple never compromises on quality, they even delay their production if they find any imperfections (I don't like iOS or use Apple though).  OnePlus should do like this. Not happy at all with this kind of support. I noticed paying more (when I got the 8gb one) was really like getting better qalutiy made device (the first one, if the issue mentioned wasn't there). This shouldn't be the case as this leads to disappointment and all variants should be given the same attention/perfection with just internal hardware changes.

"Delivers what they promised.! ;)","Great phone! Gaming performance is so great, device don't get heat up at all even at high settings! I played PUBG Mobile and details it provides were so exciting and make it feel real. Shadows of tree,stones, mud, etc. If you have small hands don't buy it for gaming, don't feel comfortable with small hands. Camera is good, can't say it is awesome! Battery life is great too, charge too fast! UI is as expected stock android, some pre-installed third party apps were also installed, you can uninstall all of them except Netflix.

"Do NOT buy this expecting a stellar camera","Obviously, you might have done extensive research, watched many review videos before coming here to make your purchase decision. There is only one way you will be happy with this purchase and that is, if you are looking for a slim, elegant, powerful, light weight device offering a premium in-hand feel. Day to day, if this is what is most important to you, then this is the device to get. Camera is going to serve you well on many occasions (when the lighting is good). People might have told you that the camera system is mediocre. That is not entirely true. There have been few software updates and I can confidently say that yes, the camera is neither great nor is it bad. It delivers decent pictures (when the lighting is good) and if you are not a absolute camera geek, then this will meet and succeed all of your expectations. Incase you are a camera geek, then get the 8Pro and dont think about saving money. Conclusion: Feels expensive and has a nice balance in the hand (Its very light and is a joy to use). The glacial green in matte finish is makes the front of the device look expensive (with the dark edge-to-edge AMOLED panel). It performs like it should. It has an QC 865 after all! It will easily get you through more than a day with a full charge. Its a very low risk decision.

"best and most reliable phone at this price","I am writing this review after using this phone for 7 days. I believe real user reviews are more useful than Youtube tech reviews which are highly biased and not practical. I bought the 6 GB variant which is available at 42k. Don't go for 8 GB variant and spend 3k more of your valuable money. For normal users, 6 GB RAM is more than sufficient. 2 GB RAM doesn't make your phone fast, it's the processor that does that work. At 42k price, this is the best option available right now. I would rate it 4.5/5. 1. Design: It is an amazing, premium looking phone. Glass back feels awesome. weight management and dimensions are also great. The curved display looks amazing. 2. Display: Display is bright and visible in direct sunlight. At the lowest brightness level, I did not notice any flickering. In Natural mode, I noticed some yellowish color, it is some software issue or it is like that only. I changed to Advanced>AMOLED wide gamut, now it works perfectly. The curved display doesn't make any difference after 1 or 2 days and it comes with ""fragile tag"" so be prepared to take extra care of it. 90hz really makes the difference over 60hz. Once you use 90hz display, going back to 60Hz would feel like the phone is lagging. 3. Performance: It is a snapdragon 865. Performance is buttery smooth. 4. Software: This is my first oneplus phone. Coming from Motorola phone, my first priority was a stock android experience. OxygenOS is best android UI right, stock android experience with all required customization. Oneplus also provide timely and long term software updates to its phones which is the very good thing. 5. Battery: I was using my phone at 90Hz all the time with all animations on. You would easily get whole day of battery life even if you are moderate to heavy user. For initial 1-2 charging cycles. I was getting around 6 hours of SOT which improved to 7-7.30 hr of SOT. Charging speed is also great, it would charge from 10 to 95% in around 50 mins. 6. Call quality and in other day to day usage, I haven't find any issues yet. Speakers are also very loud and clear. 7. Camera: here comes the one and an only area which I didn't like. Primary camera and ultrawide angle camera is good but not any improvement over 7T. and 2 MP macro camera is really pathetic and useless. I also facing some issue in front camera. Low light photos are blurry and during video calls, it zooms the face and produces blurry face. i hope Oneplus gives software updates and solves all camera problems. I found a solution for myself by downloading Gcam which is giving better results but still for 42k phone, camera is not that good. Conclusion: No phone is perfect. This has issues in camera department. but I believe other than that this phone is great, go for it. When You spend more than 35-40K, always go for brand value like Oneplus, Samsung, Apple. I hope you find this review useful.

"Great but always with some screen and body issues!","I changed OnePlus 8, 4 times! Due to something or the other defects (like headache giving screens, line marks at the back of the body, etc) as it's expensive! Phone boxes were puffed, torned, some displays were dull if noticed closely, more warm and yellowish. No control by OnePlus on this. People go nuts like ""wow what a display"" not realizing that they are being given inferior quality displays of Samsung. I hope I really hope people strive for perfection to really understand and get what they are paying for by controlling their excitements a bit and forward stronger feedbacks, as I believe I was listened and Amazon India did helped me too. My 5th device came altogether from a different location, excellent box, phone built and display feels more broader even with same dimensions, no two parallel lines design or defect at the back, it's clean and curvy like OnePlus 8 8gb variant (mine is the 6gb one). Screen display is still more warm which I didn't want but colors are very punchy and clearly shows the display is far better than previous returned devices. 1st OnePlus 8 8gb - Had a very long permanent line mark at the back of the body if looked closely. 2nd OnePlus 8 8gb - Display's blue light filter had issues I'm sure as it gave me headache in seconds, eye strain as well. 3rd OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines on edges of the back body if the device was tilted a little, was like a dent kind of design or defect (I believe though this one had the best display even than the 5th one that I'm keeping and more smoother 90 HZ). 4th OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines were again there so I thought it's normal and was okay with it, but display was yellowish and dull, playing pubg with graphics optimization made the game look more ugly in extreme hd settings (hdr sucks). Looking at Images on articles, etc were looking just good. 5th OnePlus 8 6gb variant - As told above there are no 2 parallel lines, punchy colors, not dull and very good display, however still yellowish in large part of the screen and whitish around above and right & left edges of the screen in vivid mode (I did noticed in some displays it was not this warm). I also noticed vivid mode was nicer and whiter in previous devices than this one whether they were dull or not. I also know screen being yellowish a bit makes video viewing an amazing experience to make it more natural for skin color, etc. But should be less and corrected with all the flaws mentioned. However, I'm tierd and somewhat satisfied but will want OnePlus to correct if possible with software update without compromising any quality of the display.

"Great but always with some screen and body issues!","I changed OnePlus 8, 4 times! Due to something or the other defects (like headache giving screens, line marks at the back of the body, etc) as it's expensive! Phone boxes were puffed, torned, some displays were dull if noticed closely, more warm and yellowish. No control by OnePlus on this. People go nuts like ""wow what a display"" not realizing that they are being given inferior quality displays of Samsung. I hope I really hope people strive for perfection to really understand and get what they are paying for by controlling their excitements a bit and forward stronger feedbacks, as I believe I was listened and Amazon India did helped me too. My 5th device came altogether from a different location, excellent box, phone built and display feels more broader even with same dimensions, no two parallel lines design or defect at the back, it's clean and curvy like OnePlus 8 8gb variant (mine is the 6gb one). Screen display is still more warm which I didn't want but colors are very punchy and clearly shows the display is far better than previous returned devices. 1st OnePlus 8 8gb - Had a very long permanent line mark at the back of the body if looked closely. 2nd OnePlus 8 8gb - Display's blue light filter had issues I'm sure as it gave me headache in seconds, eye strain as well. 3rd OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines on edges of the back body if the device was tilted a little, was like a dent kind of design or defect (I believe though this one had the best display even than the 5th one that I'm keeping and more smoother 90 HZ). 4th OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines were again there so I thought it's normal and was okay with it, but display was yellowish and dull, playing pubg with graphics optimization made the game look more ugly in extreme hd settings (hdr sucks). Looking at Images on articles, etc were looking just good. 5th OnePlus 8 6gb variant - As told above there are no 2 parallel lines, punchy colors, not dull and very good display, however still yellowish in large part of the screen and whitish around above and right & left edges of the screen in vivid mode (I did noticed in some displays it was not this warm). I also noticed vivid mode was nicer and whiter in previous devices than this one whether they were dull or not. I also know screen being yellowish a bit makes video viewing an amazing experience to make it more natural for skin color, etc. But should be less and corrected with all the flaws mentioned. However, I'm tierd and somewhat satisfied but will want OnePlus to correct if possible with software update without compromising any quality of the display. It's said that Apple never compromises on quality, they even delay their production if they find any imperfections (I don't like iOS or use Apple though).  OnePlus should do like this. Not happy at all with this kind of support. I noticed paying more (when I got the 8gb one) was really like getting better qalutiy made device (the first one, if the issue mentioned wasn't there). This shouldn't be the case as this leads to disappointment and all variants should be given the same attention/perfection with just internal hardware changes. OnePlus 8 will be my first and last device for a short period of time. Will look for a brand who cares. 3 out of 5.","27 Jun 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61J0cwf2PaL._SY88.jpg

"Do NOT buy this expecting a stellar camera","Obviously, you might have done extensive research, watched many review videos before coming here to make your purchase decision. There is only one way you will be happy with this purchase and that is, if you are looking for a slim, elegant, powerful, light weight device offering a premium in-hand feel. Day to day, if this is what is most important to you, then this is the device to get. Camera is going to serve you well on many occasions (when the lighting is good). People might have told you that the camera system is mediocre. That is not entirely true. There have been few software updates and I can confidently say that yes, the camera is neither great nor is it bad. It delivers decent pictures (when the lighting is good) and if you are not a absolute camera geek, then this will meet and succeed all of your expectations. Incase you are a camera geek, then get the 8Pro and dont think about saving money. Conclusion: Feels expensive and has a nice balance in the hand (Its very light and is a joy to use). The glacial green in matte finish is makes the front of the device look expensive (with the dark edge-to-edge AMOLED panel). It performs like it should. It has an QC 865 after all! It will easily get you through more than a day with a full charge. Its a very low risk decision. Cant go wrong - Just buy the damn thing!","18 Jun 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41e3+yQVw2L._SY88.jpg","True","SK","5.0","OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-547/product-reviews/B078BNQ318/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"best and most reliable phone at this price","I am writing this review after using this phone for 7 days. I believe real user reviews are more useful than Youtube tech reviews which are highly biased and not practical. I bought the 6 GB variant which is available at 42k. Don't go for 8 GB variant and spend 3k more of your valuable money. For normal users, 6 GB RAM is more than sufficient. 2 GB RAM doesn't make your phone fast, it's the processor that does that work. At 42k price, this is the best option available right now. I would rate it 4.5/5. 1. Design: It is an amazing, premium looking phone. Glass back feels awesome. weight management and dimensions are also great. The curved display looks amazing. 2. Display: Display is bright and visible in direct sunlight. At the lowest brightness level, I did not notice any flickering. In Natural mode, I noticed some yellowish color, it is some software issue or it is like that only. I changed to Advanced>AMOLED wide gamut, now it works perfectly. The curved display doesn't make any difference after 1 or 2 days and it comes with ""fragile tag"" so be prepared to take extra care of it. 90hz really makes the difference over 60hz. Once you use 90hz display, going back to 60Hz would feel like the phone is lagging. 3. Performance: It is a snapdragon 865. Performance is buttery smooth. 4. Software: This is my first oneplus phone. Coming from Motorola phone, my first priority was a stock android experience. OxygenOS is best android UI right, stock android experience with all required customization. Oneplus also provide timely and long term software updates to its phones which is the very good thing. 5. Battery: I was using my phone at 90Hz all the time with all animations on. You would easily get whole day of battery life even if you are moderate to heavy user. For initial 1-2 charging cycles. I was getting around 6 hours of SOT which improved to 7-7.30 hr of SOT. Charging speed is also great, it would charge from 10 to 95% in around 50 mins. 6. Call quality and in other day to day usage, I haven't find any issues yet. Speakers are also very loud and clear. 7. Camera: here comes the one and an only area which I didn't like. Primary camera and ultrawide angle camera is good but not any improvement over 7T. and 2 MP macro camera is really pathetic and useless. I also facing some issue in front camera. Low light photos are blurry and during video calls, it zooms the face and produces blurry face. i hope Oneplus gives software updates and solves all camera problems. I found a solution for myself by downloading Gcam which is giving better results but still for 42k phone, camera is not that good. Conclusion: No phone is perfect. This has issues in camera department. but I believe other than that this phone is great, go for it. When You spend more than 35-40K, always go for brand value like Oneplus, Samsung, Apple. I hope you find this review useful. I Will update if I find any issue in the future.","21 Jun 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","True","Vikas Shah","5.0","OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-547/product-reviews/B078BNQ318/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

Primary camera and ultrawide angle camera is good but not any improvement over 7T. and 2 MP macro camera is really pathetic and useless. I also facing some issue in front camera. Low light photos are blurry and during video calls, it zooms the face and produces blurry face. i hope Oneplus gives software updates and solves all camera problems. I found a solution for myself by downloading Gcam which is giving better results but still for 42k phone, camera is not that good. Conclusion: No phone is perfect. This has issues in camera department. but I believe other than that this phone is great, go for it. When You spend more than 35-40K, always go for brand value like Oneplus, Samsung, Apple. I hope you find this review useful.

"Great but always with some screen and body issues!","I changed OnePlus 8, 4 times! Due to something or the other defects (like headache giving screens, line marks at the back of the body, etc) as it's expensive! Phone boxes were puffed, torned, some displays were dull if noticed closely, more warm and yellowish. No control by OnePlus on this. People go nuts like ""wow what a display"" not realizing that they are being given inferior quality displays of Samsung. I hope I really hope people strive for perfection to really understand and get what they are paying for by controlling their excitements a bit and forward stronger feedbacks, as I believe I was listened and Amazon India did helped me too. My 5th device came altogether from a different location, excellent box, phone built and display feels more broader even with same dimensions, no two parallel lines design or defect at the back, it's clean and curvy like OnePlus 8 8gb variant (mine is the 6gb one). Screen display is still more warm which I didn't want but colors are very punchy and clearly shows the display is far better than previous returned devices. 1st OnePlus 8 8gb - Had a very long permanent line mark at the back of the body if looked closely. 2nd OnePlus 8 8gb - Display's blue light filter had issues I'm sure as it gave me headache in seconds, eye strain as well. 3rd OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines on edges of the back body if the device was tilted a little, was like a dent kind of design or defect (I believe though this one had the best display even than the 5th one that I'm keeping and more smoother 90 HZ). 4th OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines were again there so I thought it's normal and was okay with it, but display was yellowish and dull, playing pubg with graphics optimization made the game look more ugly in extreme hd settings (hdr sucks). Looking at Images on articles, etc were looking just good. 5th OnePlus 8 6gb variant - As told above there are no 2 parallel lines, punchy colors, not dull and very good display, however still yellowish in large part of the screen and whitish around above and right & left edges of the screen in vivid mode (I did noticed in some displays it was not this warm). I also noticed vivid mode was nicer and whiter in previous devices than this one whether they were dull or not. I also know screen being yellowish a bit makes video viewing an amazing experience to make it more natural for skin color, etc. But should be less and corrected with all the flaws mentioned. However, I'm tierd and somewhat satisfied but will want OnePlus to correct if possible with software update without compromising any quality of the display. It's said that Apple never compromises on quality, they even delay their production if they find any imperfections (I don't like iOS or use Apple though).  OnePlus should do like this. Not happy at all with this kind of support. I noticed paying more (when I got the 8gb one) was really like getting better qalutiy made device (the first one, if the issue mentioned wasn't there). This shouldn't be the case as this leads to disappointment and all variants should be given the same attention/perfection with just internal hardware changes. OnePlus 8 will be my first and last device for a short period of time. Will look for a brand who cares. 3 out of 5.","27 Jun 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61J0cwf2PaL._SY88.jpg

"Do NOT buy this expecting a stellar camera","Obviously, you might have done extensive research, watched many review videos before coming here to make your purchase decision. There is only one way you will be happy with this purchase and that is, if you are looking for a slim, elegant, powerful, light weight device offering a premium in-hand feel. Day to day, if this is what is most important to you, then this is the device to get. Camera is going to serve you well on many occasions (when the lighting is good). People might have told you that the camera system is mediocre. That is not entirely true. There have been few software updates and I can confidently say that yes, the camera is neither great nor is it bad. It delivers decent pictures (when the lighting is good) and if you are not a absolute camera geek, then this will meet and succeed all of your expectations. Incase you are a camera geek, then get the 8Pro and dont think about saving money. Conclusion: Feels expensive and has a nice balance in the hand (Its very light and is a joy to use). The glacial green in matte finish is makes the front of the device look expensive (with the dark edge-to-edge AMOLED panel). It performs like it should. It has an QC 865 after all! It will easily get you through more than a day with a full charge. Its a very low risk decision.

"best and most reliable phone at this price","I am writing this review after using this phone for 7 days. I believe real user reviews are more useful than Youtube tech reviews which are highly biased and not practical. I bought the 6 GB variant which is available at 42k. Don't go for 8 GB variant and spend 3k more of your valuable money. For normal users, 6 GB RAM is more than sufficient. 2 GB RAM doesn't make your phone fast, it's the processor that does that work. At 42k price, this is the best option available right now. I would rate it 4.5/5. 1. Design: It is an amazing, premium looking phone. Glass back feels awesome. weight management and dimensions are also great. The curved display looks amazing. 2. Display: Display is bright and visible in direct sunlight. At the lowest brightness level, I did not notice any flickering. In Natural mode, I noticed some yellowish color, it is some software issue or it is like that only. I changed to Advanced>AMOLED wide gamut, now it works perfectly. The curved display doesn't make any difference after 1 or 2 days and it comes with ""fragile tag"" so be prepared to take extra care of it. 90hz really makes the difference over 60hz. Once you use 90hz display, going back to 60Hz would feel like the phone is lagging. 3. Performance: It is a snapdragon 865. Performance is buttery smooth. 4. Software: This is my first oneplus phone. Coming from Motorola phone, my first priority was a stock android experience. OxygenOS is best android UI right, stock android experience with all required customization. Oneplus also provide timely and long term software updates to its phones which is the very good thing. 5. Battery: I was using my phone at 90Hz all the time with all animations on. You would easily get whole day of battery life even if you are moderate to heavy user. For initial 1-2 charging cycles. I was getting around 6 hours of SOT which improved to 7-7.30 hr of SOT. Charging speed is also great, it would charge from 10 to 95% in around 50 mins. 6. Call quality and in other day to day usage, I haven't find any issues yet. Speakers are also very loud and clear. 7. Camera: here comes the one and an only area which I didn't like. Primary camera and ultrawide angle camera is good but not any improvement over 7T. and 2 MP macro camera is really pathetic and useless. I also facing some issue in front camera. Low light photos are blurry and during video calls, it zooms the face and produces blurry face. i hope Oneplus gives software updates and solves all camera problems.

At the lowest brightness level, I did not notice any flickering. In Natural mode, I noticed some yellowish color, it is some software issue or it is like that only. I changed to Advanced>AMOLED wide gamut, now it works perfectly. The curved display doesn't make any difference after 1 or 2 days and it comes with ""fragile tag"" so be prepared to take extra care of it. 90hz really makes the difference over 60hz. Once you use 90hz display, going back to 60Hz would feel like the phone is lagging. 3. Performance: It is a snapdragon 865. Performance is buttery smooth. 4. Software: This is my first oneplus phone. Coming from Motorola phone, my first priority was a stock android experience. OxygenOS is best android UI right, stock android experience with all required customization. Oneplus also provide timely and long term software updates to its phones which is the very good thing. 5. Battery: I was using my phone at 90Hz all the time with all animations on. You would easily get whole day of battery life even if you are moderate to heavy user. For initial 1-2 charging cycles. I was getting around 6 hours of SOT which improved to 7-7.30 hr of SOT. Charging speed is also great, it would charge from 10 to 95% in around 50 mins. 6. Call quality and in other day to day usage, I haven't find any issues yet. Speakers are also very loud and clear. 7. Camera: here comes the one and an only area which I didn't like. Primary camera and ultrawide angle camera is good but not any improvement over 7T. and 2 MP macro camera is really pathetic and useless. I also facing some issue in front camera. Low light photos are blurry and during video calls, it zooms the face and produces blurry face. i hope Oneplus gives software updates and solves all camera problems. I found a solution for myself by downloading Gcam which is giving better results but still for 42k phone, camera is not that good. Conclusion: No phone is perfect. This has issues in camera department. but I believe other than that this phone is great, go for it. When You spend more than 35-40K, always go for brand value like Oneplus, Samsung, Apple. I hope you find this review useful. I Will update if I find any issue in the future.","21 Jun 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","True","Vikas Shah","5.0","OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-547/product-reviews/B078BNQ318/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"Great but always with some screen and body issues!","I changed OnePlus 8, 4 times! Due to something or the other defects (like headache giving screens, line marks at the back of the body, etc) as it's expensive! Phone boxes were puffed, torned, some displays were dull if noticed closely, more warm and yellowish. No control by OnePlus on this. People go nuts like ""wow what a display"" not realizing that they are being given inferior quality displays of Samsung. I hope I really hope people strive for perfection to really understand and get what they are paying for by controlling their excitements a bit and forward stronger feedbacks, as I believe I was listened and Amazon India did helped me too. My 5th device came altogether from a different location, excellent box, phone built and display feels more broader even with same dimensions, no two parallel lines design or defect at the back, it's clean and curvy like OnePlus 8 8gb variant (mine is the 6gb one). Screen display is still more warm which I didn't want but colors are very punchy and clearly shows the display is far better than previous returned devices. 1st OnePlus 8 8gb - Had a very long permanent line mark at the back of the body if looked closely. 2nd OnePlus 8 8gb - Display's blue light filter had issues I'm sure as it gave me headache in seconds, eye strain as well. 3rd OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines on edges of the back body if the device was tilted a little, was like a dent kind of design or defect (I believe though this one had the best display even than the 5th one that I'm keeping and more smoother 90 HZ). 4th OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines were again there so I thought it's normal and was okay with it, but display was yellowish and dull, playing pubg with graphics optimization made the game look more ugly in extreme hd settings (hdr sucks). Looking at Images on articles, etc were looking just good. 5th OnePlus 8 6gb variant - As told above there are no 2 parallel lines, punchy colors, not dull and very good display, however still yellowish in large part of the screen and whitish around above and right & left edges of the screen in vivid mode (I did noticed in some displays it was not this warm). I also noticed vivid mode was nicer and whiter in previous devices than this one whether they were dull or not. I also know screen being yellowish a bit makes video viewing an amazing experience to make it more natural for skin color, etc. But should be less and corrected with all the flaws mentioned. However, I'm tierd and somewhat satisfied but will want OnePlus to correct if possible with software update without compromising any quality of the display. It's said that Apple never compromises on quality, they even delay their production if they find any imperfections (I don't like iOS or use Apple though).  OnePlus should do like this. Not happy at all with this kind of support. I noticed paying more (when I got the 8gb one) was really like getting better qalutiy made device (the first one, if the issue mentioned wasn't there). This shouldn't be the case as this leads to disappointment and all variants should be given the same attention/perfection with just internal hardware changes. OnePlus 8 will be my first and last device for a short period of time. Will look for a brand who cares. 3 out of 5.","27 Jun 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61J0cwf2PaL._SY88.jpg

"Do NOT buy this expecting a stellar camera","Obviously, you might have done extensive research, watched many review videos before coming here to make your purchase decision. There is only one way you will be happy with this purchase and that is, if you are looking for a slim, elegant, powerful, light weight device offering a premium in-hand feel. Day to day, if this is what is most important to you, then this is the device to get. Camera is going to serve you well on many occasions (when the lighting is good). People might have told you that the camera system is mediocre. That is not entirely true. There have been few software updates and I can confidently say that yes, the camera is neither great nor is it bad. It delivers decent pictures (when the lighting is good) and if you are not a absolute camera geek, then this will meet and succeed all of your expectations. Incase you are a camera geek, then get the 8Pro and dont think about saving money. Conclusion: Feels expensive and has a nice balance in the hand (Its very light and is a joy to use). The glacial green in matte finish is makes the front of the device look expensive (with the dark edge-to-edge AMOLED panel). It performs like it should. It has an QC 865 after all! It will easily get you through more than a day with a full charge. Its a very low risk decision. Cant go wrong - Just buy the damn thing!","18 Jun 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41e3+yQVw2L._SY88.jpg","True","SK","5.0","OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-547/product-reviews/B078BNQ318/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"best and most reliable phone at this price","I am writing this review after using this phone for 7 days. I believe real user reviews are more useful than Youtube tech reviews which are highly biased and not practical. I bought the 6 GB variant which is available at 42k. Don't go for 8 GB variant and spend 3k more of your valuable money. For normal users, 6 GB RAM is more than sufficient. 2 GB RAM doesn't make your phone fast, it's the processor that does that work. At 42k price, this is the best option available right now. I would rate it 4.5/5. 1. Design: It is an amazing, premium looking phone. Glass back feels awesome. weight management and dimensions are also great. The curved display looks amazing. 2. Display: Display is bright and visible in direct sunlight. At the lowest brightness level, I did not notice any flickering. In Natural mode, I noticed some yellowish color, it is some software issue or it is like that only. I changed to Advanced>AMOLED wide gamut, now it works perfectly. The curved display doesn't make any difference after 1 or 2 days and it comes with ""fragile tag"" so be prepared to take extra care of it. 90hz really makes the difference over 60hz. Once you use 90hz display, going back to 60Hz would feel like the phone is lagging. 3. Performance: It is a snapdragon 865. Performance is buttery smooth. 4. Software: This is my first oneplus phone. Coming from Motorola phone, my first priority was a stock android experience. OxygenOS is best android UI right, stock android experience with all required customization. Oneplus also provide timely and long term software updates to its phones which is the very good thing. 5. Battery: I was using my phone at 90Hz all the time with all animations on. You would easily get whole day of battery life even if you are moderate to heavy user. For initial 1-2 charging cycles. I was getting around 6 hours of SOT which improved to 7-7.30 hr of SOT.

"best and most reliable phone at this price","I am writing this review after using this phone for 7 days. I believe real user reviews are more useful than Youtube tech reviews which are highly biased and not practical. I bought the 6 GB variant which is available at 42k. Don't go for 8 GB variant and spend 3k more of your valuable money. For normal users, 6 GB RAM is more than sufficient. 2 GB RAM doesn't make your phone fast, it's the processor that does that work. At 42k price, this is the best option available right now. I would rate it 4.5/5. 1. Design: It is an amazing, premium looking phone. Glass back feels awesome. weight management and dimensions are also great. The curved display looks amazing. 2. Display: Display is bright and visible in direct sunlight. At the lowest brightness level, I did not notice any flickering. In Natural mode, I noticed some yellowish color, it is some software issue or it is like that only. I changed to Advanced>AMOLED wide gamut, now it works perfectly. The curved display doesn't make any difference after 1 or 2 days and it comes with ""fragile tag"" so be prepared to take extra care of it. 90hz really makes the difference over 60hz. Once you use 90hz display, going back to 60Hz would feel like the phone is lagging. 3. Performance: It is a snapdragon 865. Performance is buttery smooth. 4. Software: This is my first oneplus phone. Coming from Motorola phone, my first priority was a stock android experience. OxygenOS is best android UI right, stock android experience with all required customization. Oneplus also provide timely and long term software updates to its phones which is the very good thing. 5. Battery: I was using my phone at 90Hz all the time with all animations on. You would easily get whole day of battery life even if you are moderate to heavy user. For initial 1-2 charging cycles. I was getting around 6 hours of SOT which improved to 7-7.30 hr of SOT. Charging speed is also great, it would charge from 10 to 95% in around 50 mins. 6. Call quality and in other day to day usage, I haven't find any issues yet. Speakers are also very loud and clear. 7. Camera: here comes the one and an only area which I didn't like. Primary camera and ultrawide angle camera is good but not any improvement over 7T. and 2 MP macro camera is really pathetic and useless. I also facing some issue in front camera. Low light photos are blurry and during video calls, it zooms the face and produces blurry face. i hope Oneplus gives software updates and solves all camera problems. I found a solution for myself by downloading Gcam which is giving better results but still for 42k phone, camera is not that good. Conclusion: No phone is perfect. This has issues in camera department. but I believe other than that this phone is great, go for it. When You spend more than 35-40K, always go for brand value like Oneplus, Samsung, Apple. I hope you find this review useful. I Will update if I find any issue in the future.","21 Jun 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","True","Vikas Shah","5.0","OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-547/product-reviews/B078BNQ318/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"Great but always with some screen and body issues!","I changed OnePlus 8, 4 times! Due to something or the other defects (like headache giving screens, line marks at the back of the body, etc) as it's expensive! Phone boxes were puffed, torned, some displays were dull if noticed closely, more warm and yellowish. No control by OnePlus on this. People go nuts like ""wow what a display"" not realizing that they are being given inferior quality displays of Samsung. I hope I really hope people strive for perfection to really understand and get what they are paying for by controlling their excitements a bit and forward stronger feedbacks, as I believe I was listened and Amazon India did helped me too. My 5th device came altogether from a different location, excellent box, phone built and display feels more broader even with same dimensions, no two parallel lines design or defect at the back, it's clean and curvy like OnePlus 8 8gb variant (mine is the 6gb one). Screen display is still more warm which I didn't want but colors are very punchy and clearly shows the display is far better than previous returned devices. 1st OnePlus 8 8gb - Had a very long permanent line mark at the back of the body if looked closely. 2nd OnePlus 8 8gb - Display's blue light filter had issues I'm sure as it gave me headache in seconds, eye strain as well. 3rd OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines on edges of the back body if the device was tilted a little, was like a dent kind of design or defect (I believe though this one had the best display even than the 5th one that I'm keeping and more smoother 90 HZ). 4th OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines were again there so I thought it's normal and was okay with it, but display was yellowish and dull, playing pubg with graphics optimization made the game look more ugly in extreme hd settings (hdr sucks). Looking at Images on articles, etc were looking just good. 5th OnePlus 8 6gb variant - As told above there are no 2 parallel lines, punchy colors, not dull and very good display, however still yellowish in large part of the screen and whitish around above and right & left edges of the screen in vivid mode (I did noticed in some displays it was not this warm). I also noticed vivid mode was nicer and whiter in previous devices than this one whether they were dull or not. I also know screen being yellowish a bit makes video viewing an amazing experience to make it more natural for skin color, etc. But should be less and corrected with all the flaws mentioned. However, I'm tierd and somewhat satisfied but will want OnePlus to correct if possible with software update without compromising any quality of the display. It's said that Apple never compromises on quality, they even delay their production if they find any imperfections (I don't like iOS or use Apple though).  OnePlus should do like this. Not happy at all with this kind of support. I noticed paying more (when I got the 8gb one) was really like getting better qalutiy made device (the first one, if the issue mentioned wasn't there). This shouldn't be the case as this leads to disappointment and all variants should be given the same attention/perfection with just internal hardware changes. OnePlus 8 will be my first and last device for a short period of time. Will look for a brand who cares. 3 out of 5.","27 Jun 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61J0cwf2PaL._SY88.jpg

"Do NOT buy this expecting a stellar camera","Obviously, you might have done extensive research, watched many review videos before coming here to make your purchase decision. There is only one way you will be happy with this purchase and that is, if you are looking for a slim, elegant, powerful, light weight device offering a premium in-hand feel. Day to day, if this is what is most important to you, then this is the device to get. Camera is going to serve you well on many occasions (when the lighting is good). People might have told you that the camera system is mediocre. That is not entirely true. There have been few software updates and I can confidently say that yes, the camera is neither great nor is it bad. It delivers decent pictures (when the lighting is good) and if you are not a absolute camera geek, then this will meet and succeed all of your expectations. Incase you are a camera geek, then get the 8Pro and dont think about saving money. Conclusion: Feels expensive and has a nice balance in the hand (Its very light and is a joy to use). The glacial green in matte finish is makes the front of the device look expensive (with the dark edge-to-edge AMOLED panel). It performs like it should. It has an QC 865 after all! It will easily get you through more than a day with a full charge. Its a very low risk decision. Cant go wrong - Just buy the damn thing!","18 Jun 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41e3+yQVw2L._SY88.jpg","True","SK","5.0","OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-547/product-reviews/B078BNQ318/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"Do NOT buy this expecting a stellar camera","Obviously, you might have done extensive research, watched many review videos before coming here to make your purchase decision. There is only one way you will be happy with this purchase and that is, if you are looking for a slim, elegant, powerful, light weight device offering a premium in-hand feel. Day to day, if this is what is most important to you, then this is the device to get. Camera is going to serve you well on many occasions (when the lighting is good). People might have told you that the camera system is mediocre. That is not entirely true. There have been few software updates and I can confidently say that yes, the camera is neither great nor is it bad. It delivers decent pictures (when the lighting is good) and if you are not a absolute camera geek, then this will meet and succeed all of your expectations. Incase you are a camera geek, then get the 8Pro and dont think about saving money. Conclusion: Feels expensive and has a nice balance in the hand (Its very light and is a joy to use). The glacial green in matte finish is makes the front of the device look expensive (with the dark edge-to-edge AMOLED panel). It performs like it should. It has an QC 865 after all! It will easily get you through more than a day with a full charge. Its a very low risk decision. Cant go wrong - Just buy the damn thing!","18 Jun 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41e3+yQVw2L._SY88.jpg","True","SK","5.0","OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-547/product-reviews/B078BNQ318/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"best and most reliable phone at this price","I am writing this review after using this phone for 7 days. I believe real user reviews are more useful than Youtube tech reviews which are highly biased and not practical. I bought the 6 GB variant which is available at 42k. Don't go for 8 GB variant and spend 3k more of your valuable money. For normal users, 6 GB RAM is more than sufficient. 2 GB RAM doesn't make your phone fast, it's the processor that does that work. At 42k price, this is the best option available right now. I would rate it 4.5/5. 1. Design: It is an amazing, premium looking phone. Glass back feels awesome. weight management and dimensions are also great. The curved display looks amazing. 2. Display: Display is bright and visible in direct sunlight. At the lowest brightness level, I did not notice any flickering. In Natural mode, I noticed some yellowish color, it is some software issue or it is like that only. I changed to Advanced>AMOLED wide gamut, now it works perfectly. The curved display doesn't make any difference after 1 or 2 days and it comes with ""fragile tag"" so be prepared to take extra care of it. 90hz really makes the difference over 60hz. Once you use 90hz display, going back to 60Hz would feel like the phone is lagging. 3. Performance: It is a snapdragon 865. Performance is buttery smooth. 4. Software: This is my first oneplus phone. Coming from Motorola phone, my first priority was a stock android experience. OxygenOS is best android UI right, stock android experience with all required customization. Oneplus also provide timely and long term software updates to its phones which is the very good thing. 5. Battery: I was using my phone at 90Hz all the time with all animations on. You would easily get whole day of battery life even if you are moderate to heavy user. For initial 1-2 charging cycles. I was getting around 6 hours of SOT which improved to 7-7.30 hr of SOT. Charging speed is also great, it would charge from 10 to 95% in around 50 mins. 6. Call quality and in other day to day usage, I haven't find any issues yet. Speakers are also very loud and clear. 7. Camera: here comes the one and an only area which I didn't like. Primary camera and ultrawide angle camera is good but not any improvement over 7T. and 2 MP macro camera is really pathetic and useless. I also facing some issue in front camera. Low light photos are blurry and during video calls, it zooms the face and produces blurry face. i hope Oneplus gives software updates and solves all camera problems. I found a solution for myself by downloading Gcam which is giving better results but still for 42k phone, camera is not that good. Conclusion: No phone is perfect. This has issues in camera department. but I believe other than that this phone is great, go for it. When You spend more than 35-40K, always go for brand value like Oneplus, Samsung, Apple. I hope you find this review useful. I Will update if I find any issue in the future.","21 Jun 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","True","Vikas Shah","5.0","OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-547/product-reviews/B078BNQ318/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"Great but always with some screen and body issues!","I changed OnePlus 8, 4 times! Due to something or the other defects (like headache giving screens, line marks at the back of the body, etc) as it's expensive! Phone boxes were puffed, torned, some displays were dull if noticed closely, more warm and yellowish. No control by OnePlus on this. People go nuts like ""wow what a display"" not realizing that they are being given inferior quality displays of Samsung. I hope I really hope people strive for perfection to really understand and get what they are paying for by controlling their excitements a bit and forward stronger feedbacks, as I believe I was listened and Amazon India did helped me too. My 5th device came altogether from a different location, excellent box, phone built and display feels more broader even with same dimensions, no two parallel lines design or defect at the back, it's clean and curvy like OnePlus 8 8gb variant (mine is the 6gb one). Screen display is still more warm which I didn't want but colors are very punchy and clearly shows the display is far better than previous returned devices. 1st OnePlus 8 8gb - Had a very long permanent line mark at the back of the body if looked closely. 2nd OnePlus 8 8gb - Display's blue light filter had issues I'm sure as it gave me headache in seconds, eye strain as well. 3rd OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines on edges of the back body if the device was tilted a little, was like a dent kind of design or defect (I believe though this one had the best display even than the 5th one that I'm keeping and more smoother 90 HZ). 4th OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines were again there so I thought it's normal and was okay with it, but display was yellowish and dull, playing pubg with graphics optimization made the game look more ugly in extreme hd settings (hdr sucks). Looking at Images on articles, etc were looking just good. 5th OnePlus 8 6gb variant - As told above there are no 2 parallel lines, punchy colors, not dull and very good display, however still yellowish in large part of the screen and whitish around above and right & left edges of the screen in vivid mode (I did noticed in some displays it was not this warm). I also noticed vivid mode was nicer and whiter in previous devices than this one whether they were dull or not. I also know screen being yellowish a bit makes video viewing an amazing experience to make it more natural for skin color, etc. But should be less and corrected with all the flaws mentioned. However, I'm tierd and somewhat satisfied but will want OnePlus to correct if possible with software update without compromising any quality of the display. It's said that Apple never compromises on quality, they even delay their production if they find any imperfections (I don't like iOS or use Apple though).  OnePlus should do like this. Not happy at all with this kind of support. I noticed paying more (when I got the 8gb one) was really like getting better qalutiy made device (the first one, if the issue mentioned wasn't there). This shouldn't be the case as this leads to disappointment and all variants should be given the same attention/perfection with just internal hardware changes. OnePlus 8 will be my first and last device for a short period of time. Will look for a brand who cares. 3 out of 5.","27 Jun 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61J0cwf2PaL._SY88.jpg

"Do NOT buy this expecting a stellar camera","Obviously, you might have done extensive research, watched many review videos before coming here to make your purchase decision. There is only one way you will be happy with this purchase and that is, if you are looking for a slim, elegant, powerful, light weight device offering a premium in-hand feel. Day to day, if this is what is most important to you, then this is the device to get. Camera is going to serve you well on many occasions (when the lighting is good). People might have told you that the camera system is mediocre. That is not entirely true. There have been few software updates and I can confidently say that yes, the camera is neither great nor is it bad. It delivers decent pictures (when the lighting is good) and if you are not a absolute camera geek, then this will meet and succeed all of your expectations. Incase you are a camera geek, then get the 8Pro and dont think about saving money. Conclusion: Feels expensive and has a nice balance in the hand (Its very light and is a joy to use). The glacial green in matte finish is makes the front of the device look expensive (with the dark edge-to-edge AMOLED panel). It performs like it should. It has an QC 865 after all! It will easily get you through more than a day with a full charge. Its a very low risk decision. Cant go wrong - Just buy the damn thing!","18 Jun 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41e3+yQVw2L._SY88.jpg","True","SK","5.0","OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-547/product-reviews/B078BNQ318/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"best and most reliable phone at this price","I am writing this review after using this phone for 7 days. I believe real user reviews are more useful than Youtube tech reviews which are highly biased and not practical. I bought the 6 GB variant which is available at 42k. Don't go for 8 GB variant and spend 3k more of your valuable money. For normal users, 6 GB RAM is more than sufficient. 2 GB RAM doesn't make your phone fast, it's the processor that does that work. At 42k price, this is the best option available right now. I would rate it 4.5/5. 1. Design: It is an amazing, premium looking phone. Glass back feels awesome. weight management and dimensions are also great. The curved display looks amazing. 2. Display: Display is bright and visible in direct sunlight. At the lowest brightness level, I did not notice any flickering. In Natural mode, I noticed some yellowish color, it is some software issue or it is like that only. I changed to Advanced>AMOLED wide gamut, now it works perfectly. The curved display doesn't make any difference after 1 or 2 days and it comes with ""fragile tag"" so be prepared to take extra care of it. 90hz really makes the difference over 60hz. Once you use 90hz display, going back to 60Hz would feel like the phone is lagging. 3. Performance: It is a snapdragon 865. Performance is buttery smooth. 4. Software: This is my first oneplus phone. Coming from Motorola phone, my first priority was a stock android experience. OxygenOS is best android UI right, stock android experience with all required customization. Oneplus also provide timely and long term software updates to its phones which is the very good thing. 5. Battery: I was using my phone at 90Hz all the time with all animations on. You would easily get whole day of battery life even if you are moderate to heavy user. For initial 1-2 charging cycles. I was getting around 6 hours of SOT which improved to 7-7.30 hr of SOT. Charging speed is also great, it would charge from 10 to 95% in around 50 mins. 6. Call quality and in other day to day usage, I haven't find any issues yet. Speakers are also very loud and clear. 7. Camera: here comes the one and an only area which I didn't like. Primary camera and ultrawide angle camera is good but not any improvement over 7T. and 2 MP macro camera is really pathetic and useless. I also facing some issue in front camera. Low light photos are blurry and during video calls, it zooms the face and produces blurry face. i hope Oneplus gives software updates and solves all camera problems. I found a solution for myself by downloading Gcam which is giving better results but still for 42k phone, camera is not that good. Conclusion: No phone is perfect. This has issues in camera department. but I believe other than that this phone is great, go for it. When You spend more than 35-40K, always go for brand value like Oneplus, Samsung, Apple. I hope you find this review useful. I Will update if I find any issue in the future.","21 Jun 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","True","Vikas Shah","5.0","OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-547/product-reviews/B078BNQ318/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"Great but always with some screen and body issues!","I changed OnePlus 8, 4 times! Due to something or the other defects (like headache giving screens, line marks at the back of the body, etc) as it's expensive! Phone boxes were puffed, torned, some displays were dull if noticed closely, more warm and yellowish. No control by OnePlus on this. People go nuts like ""wow what a display"" not realizing that they are being given inferior quality displays of Samsung. I hope I really hope people strive for perfection to really understand and get what they are paying for by controlling their excitements a bit and forward stronger feedbacks, as I believe I was listened and Amazon India did helped me too. My 5th device came altogether from a different location, excellent box, phone built and display feels more broader even with same dimensions, no two parallel lines design or defect at the back, it's clean and curvy like OnePlus 8 8gb variant (mine is the 6gb one). Screen display is still more warm which I didn't want but colors are very punchy and clearly shows the display is far better than previous returned devices. 1st OnePlus 8 8gb - Had a very long permanent line mark at the back of the body if looked closely. 2nd OnePlus 8 8gb - Display's blue light filter had issues I'm sure as it gave me headache in seconds, eye strain as well. 3rd OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines on edges of the back body if the device was tilted a little, was like a dent kind of design or defect (I believe though this one had the best display even than the 5th one that I'm keeping and more smoother 90 HZ). 4th OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines were again there so I thought it's normal and was okay with it, but display was yellowish and dull, playing pubg with graphics optimization made the game look more ugly in extreme hd settings (hdr sucks). Looking at Images on articles, etc were looking just good. 5th OnePlus 8 6gb variant - As told above there are no 2 parallel lines, punchy colors, not dull and very good display, however still yellowish in large part of the screen and whitish around above and right & left edges of the screen in vivid mode (I did noticed in some displays it was not this warm). I also noticed vivid mode was nicer and whiter in previous devices than this one whether they were dull or not. I also know screen being yellowish a bit makes video viewing an amazing experience to make it more natural for skin color, etc. But should be less and corrected with all the flaws mentioned. However, I'm tierd and somewhat satisfied but will want OnePlus to correct if possible with software update without compromising any quality of the display. It's said that Apple never compromises on quality, they even delay their production if they find any imperfections (I don't like iOS or use Apple though).  OnePlus should do like this. Not happy at all with this kind of support. I noticed paying more (when I got the 8gb one) was really like getting better qalutiy made device (the first one, if the issue mentioned wasn't there). This shouldn't be the case as this leads to disappointment and all variants should be given the same attention/perfection with just internal hardware changes. OnePlus 8 will be my first and last device for a short period of time. Will look for a brand who cares. 3 out of 5.","27 Jun 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61J0cwf2PaL._SY88.jpg

"Do NOT buy this expecting a stellar camera","Obviously, you might have done extensive research, watched many review videos before coming here to make your purchase decision. There is only one way you will be happy with this purchase and that is, if you are looking for a slim, elegant, powerful, light weight device offering a premium in-hand feel. Day to day, if this is what is most important to you, then this is the device to get. Camera is going to serve you well on many occasions (when the lighting is good). People might have told you that the camera system is mediocre. That is not entirely true. There have been few software updates and I can confidently say that yes, the camera is neither great nor is it bad. It delivers decent pictures (when the lighting is good) and if you are not a absolute camera geek, then this will meet and succeed all of your expectations. Incase you are a camera geek, then get the 8Pro and dont think about saving money. Conclusion: Feels expensive and has a nice balance in the hand (Its very light and is a joy to use). The glacial green in matte finish is makes the front of the device look expensive (with the dark edge-to-edge AMOLED panel). It performs like it should. It has an QC 865 after all! It will easily get you through more than a day with a full charge. Its a very low risk decision.

"best and most reliable phone at this price","I am writing this review after using this phone for 7 days. I believe real user reviews are more useful than Youtube tech reviews which are highly biased and not practical. I bought the 6 GB variant which is available at 42k. Don't go for 8 GB variant and spend 3k more of your valuable money. For normal users, 6 GB RAM is more than sufficient. 2 GB RAM doesn't make your phone fast, it's the processor that does that work. At 42k price, this is the best option available right now. I would rate it 4.5/5. 1. Design: It is an amazing, premium looking phone. Glass back feels awesome. weight management and dimensions are also great. The curved display looks amazing. 2. Display: Display is bright and visible in direct sunlight. At the lowest brightness level, I did not notice any flickering. In Natural mode, I noticed some yellowish color, it is some software issue or it is like that only. I changed to Advanced>AMOLED wide gamut, now it works perfectly. The curved display doesn't make any difference after 1 or 2 days and it comes with ""fragile tag"" so be prepared to take extra care of it. 90hz really makes the difference over 60hz. Once you use 90hz display, going back to 60Hz would feel like the phone is lagging. 3. Performance: It is a snapdragon 865. Performance is buttery smooth. 4. Software: This is my first oneplus phone. Coming from Motorola phone, my first priority was a stock android experience. OxygenOS is best android UI right, stock android experience with all required customization. Oneplus also provide timely and long term software updates to its phones which is the very good thing. 5. Battery: I was using my phone at 90Hz all the time with all animations on. You would easily get whole day of battery life even if you are moderate to heavy user. For initial 1-2 charging cycles. I was getting around 6 hours of SOT which improved to 7-7.30 hr of SOT. Charging speed is also great, it would charge from 10 to 95% in around 50 mins. 6. Call quality and in other day to day usage, I haven't find any issues yet. Speakers are also very loud and clear. 7. Camera: here comes the one and an only area which I didn't like. Primary camera and ultrawide angle camera is good but not any improvement over 7T. and 2 MP macro camera is really pathetic and useless. I also facing some issue in front camera. Low light photos are blurry and during video calls, it zooms the face and produces blurry face. i hope Oneplus gives software updates and solves all camera problems. I found a solution for myself by downloading Gcam which is giving better results but still for 42k phone, camera is not that good. Conclusion: No phone is perfect. This has issues in camera department. but I believe other than that this phone is great, go for it. When You spend more than 35-40K, always go for brand value like Oneplus, Samsung, Apple. I hope you find this review useful.

"Great but always with some screen and body issues!","I changed OnePlus 8, 4 times! Due to something or the other defects (like headache giving screens, line marks at the back of the body, etc) as it's expensive! Phone boxes were puffed, torned, some displays were dull if noticed closely, more warm and yellowish. No control by OnePlus on this. People go nuts like ""wow what a display"" not realizing that they are being given inferior quality displays of Samsung. I hope I really hope people strive for perfection to really understand and get what they are paying for by controlling their excitements a bit and forward stronger feedbacks, as I believe I was listened and Amazon India did helped me too. My 5th device came altogether from a different location, excellent box, phone built and display feels more broader even with same dimensions, no two parallel lines design or defect at the back, it's clean and curvy like OnePlus 8 8gb variant (mine is the 6gb one). Screen display is still more warm which I didn't want but colors are very punchy and clearly shows the display is far better than previous returned devices. 1st OnePlus 8 8gb - Had a very long permanent line mark at the back of the body if looked closely. 2nd OnePlus 8 8gb - Display's blue light filter had issues I'm sure as it gave me headache in seconds, eye strain as well. 3rd OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines on edges of the back body if the device was tilted a little, was like a dent kind of design or defect (I believe though this one had the best display even than the 5th one that I'm keeping and more smoother 90 HZ). 4th OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines were again there so I thought it's normal and was okay with it, but display was yellowish and dull, playing pubg with graphics optimization made the game look more ugly in extreme hd settings (hdr sucks). Looking at Images on articles, etc were looking just good. 5th OnePlus 8 6gb variant - As told above there are no 2 parallel lines, punchy colors, not dull and very good display, however still yellowish in large part of the screen and whitish around above and right & left edges of the screen in vivid mode (I did noticed in some displays it was not this warm). I also noticed vivid mode was nicer and whiter in previous devices than this one whether they were dull or not. I also know screen being yellowish a bit makes video viewing an amazing experience to make it more natural for skin color, etc. But should be less and corrected with all the flaws mentioned. However, I'm tierd and somewhat satisfied but will want OnePlus to correct if possible with software update without compromising any quality of the display. It's said that Apple never compromises on quality, they even delay their production if they find any imperfections (I don't like iOS or use Apple though).  OnePlus should do like this. Not happy at all with this kind of support. I noticed paying more (when I got the 8gb one) was really like getting better qalutiy made device (the first one, if the issue mentioned wasn't there). This shouldn't be the case as this leads to disappointment and all variants should be given the same attention/perfection with just internal hardware changes. OnePlus 8 will be my first and last device for a short period of time. Will look for a brand who cares. 3 out of 5.","27 Jun 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61J0cwf2PaL._SY88.jpg

"Delivers what they promised.! ;)","Great phone! Gaming performance is so great, device don't get heat up at all even at high settings! I played PUBG Mobile and details it provides were so exciting and make it feel real. Shadows of tree,stones, mud, etc. If you have small hands don't buy it for gaming, don't feel comfortable with small hands. Camera is good, can't say it is awesome! Battery life is great too, charge too fast! UI is as expected stock android, some pre-installed third party apps were also installed, you can uninstall all of them except Netflix. The back cover they provide is loose and cheap. Have to buy a new better one! Over all a great phone!

"Delivers what they promised.! ;)","Great phone! Gaming performance is so great, device don't get heat up at all even at high settings! I played PUBG Mobile and details it provides were so exciting and make it feel real. Shadows of tree,stones, mud, etc. If you have small hands don't buy it for gaming, don't feel comfortable with small hands. Camera is good, can't say it is awesome! Battery life is great too, charge too fast! UI is as expected stock android, some pre-installed third party apps were also installed, you can uninstall all of them except Netflix.

"Do NOT buy this expecting a stellar camera","Obviously, you might have done extensive research, watched many review videos before coming here to make your purchase decision. There is only one way you will be happy with this purchase and that is, if you are looking for a slim, elegant, powerful, light weight device offering a premium in-hand feel. Day to day, if this is what is most important to you, then this is the device to get. Camera is going to serve you well on many occasions (when the lighting is good). People might have told you that the camera system is mediocre. That is not entirely true. There have been few software updates and I can confidently say that yes, the camera is neither great nor is it bad. It delivers decent pictures (when the lighting is good) and if you are not a absolute camera geek, then this will meet and succeed all of your expectations. Incase you are a camera geek, then get the 8Pro and dont think about saving money. Conclusion: Feels expensive and has a nice balance in the hand (Its very light and is a joy to use). The glacial green in matte finish is makes the front of the device look expensive (with the dark edge-to-edge AMOLED panel). It performs like it should. It has an QC 865 after all! It will easily get you through more than a day with a full charge. Its a very low risk decision.

"best and most reliable phone at this price","I am writing this review after using this phone for 7 days. I believe real user reviews are more useful than Youtube tech reviews which are highly biased and not practical. I bought the 6 GB variant which is available at 42k. Don't go for 8 GB variant and spend 3k more of your valuable money. For normal users, 6 GB RAM is more than sufficient. 2 GB RAM doesn't make your phone fast, it's the processor that does that work. At 42k price, this is the best option available right now. I would rate it 4.5/5. 1. Design: It is an amazing, premium looking phone. Glass back feels awesome. weight management and dimensions are also great. The curved display looks amazing. 2. Display: Display is bright and visible in direct sunlight. At the lowest brightness level, I did not notice any flickering. In Natural mode, I noticed some yellowish color, it is some software issue or it is like that only. I changed to Advanced>AMOLED wide gamut, now it works perfectly. The curved display doesn't make any difference after 1 or 2 days and it comes with ""fragile tag"" so be prepared to take extra care of it. 90hz really makes the difference over 60hz. Once you use 90hz display, going back to 60Hz would feel like the phone is lagging. 3. Performance: It is a snapdragon 865. Performance is buttery smooth. 4. Software: This is my first oneplus phone. Coming from Motorola phone, my first priority was a stock android experience. OxygenOS is best android UI right, stock android experience with all required customization. Oneplus also provide timely and long term software updates to its phones which is the very good thing. 5. Battery: I was using my phone at 90Hz all the time with all animations on. You would easily get whole day of battery life even if you are moderate to heavy user. For initial 1-2 charging cycles. I was getting around 6 hours of SOT which improved to 7-7.30 hr of SOT. Charging speed is also great, it would charge from 10 to 95% in around 50 mins. 6. Call quality and in other day to day usage, I haven't find any issues yet. Speakers are also very loud and clear. 7. Camera: here comes the one and an only area which I didn't like. Primary camera and ultrawide angle camera is good but not any improvement over 7T. and 2 MP macro camera is really pathetic and useless. I also facing some issue in front camera. Low light photos are blurry and during video calls, it zooms the face and produces blurry face. i hope Oneplus gives software updates and solves all camera problems. I found a solution for myself by downloading Gcam which is giving better results but still for 42k phone, camera is not that good. Conclusion: No phone is perfect. This has issues in camera department. but I believe other than that this phone is great, go for it. When You spend more than 35-40K, always go for brand value like Oneplus, Samsung, Apple. I hope you find this review useful.

"Great but always with some screen and body issues!","I changed OnePlus 8, 4 times! Due to something or the other defects (like headache giving screens, line marks at the back of the body, etc) as it's expensive! Phone boxes were puffed, torned, some displays were dull if noticed closely, more warm and yellowish. No control by OnePlus on this. People go nuts like ""wow what a display"" not realizing that they are being given inferior quality displays of Samsung. I hope I really hope people strive for perfection to really understand and get what they are paying for by controlling their excitements a bit and forward stronger feedbacks, as I believe I was listened and Amazon India did helped me too. My 5th device came altogether from a different location, excellent box, phone built and display feels more broader even with same dimensions, no two parallel lines design or defect at the back, it's clean and curvy like OnePlus 8 8gb variant (mine is the 6gb one). Screen display is still more warm which I didn't want but colors are very punchy and clearly shows the display is far better than previous returned devices. 1st OnePlus 8 8gb - Had a very long permanent line mark at the back of the body if looked closely. 2nd OnePlus 8 8gb - Display's blue light filter had issues I'm sure as it gave me headache in seconds, eye strain as well. 3rd OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines on edges of the back body if the device was tilted a little, was like a dent kind of design or defect (I believe though this one had the best display even than the 5th one that I'm keeping and more smoother 90 HZ). 4th OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines were again there so I thought it's normal and was okay with it, but display was yellowish and dull, playing pubg with graphics optimization made the game look more ugly in extreme hd settings (hdr sucks). Looking at Images on articles, etc were looking just good. 5th OnePlus 8 6gb variant - As told above there are no 2 parallel lines, punchy colors, not dull and very good display, however still yellowish in large part of the screen and whitish around above and right & left edges of the screen in vivid mode (I did noticed in some displays it was not this warm). I also noticed vivid mode was nicer and whiter in previous devices than this one whether they were dull or not. I also know screen being yellowish a bit makes video viewing an amazing experience to make it more natural for skin color, etc. But should be less and corrected with all the flaws mentioned. However, I'm tierd and somewhat satisfied but will want OnePlus to correct if possible with software update without compromising any quality of the display. It's said that Apple never compromises on quality, they even delay their production if they find any imperfections (I don't like iOS or use Apple though).  OnePlus should do like this. Not happy at all with this kind of support. I noticed paying more (when I got the 8gb one) was really like getting better qalutiy made device (the first one, if the issue mentioned wasn't there). This shouldn't be the case as this leads to disappointment and all variants should be given the same attention/perfection with just internal hardware changes. OnePlus 8 will be my first and last device for a short period of time. Will look for a brand who cares. 3 out of 5.","27 Jun 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61J0cwf2PaL._SY88.jpg

Looking at Images on articles, etc were looking just good. 5th OnePlus 8 6gb variant - As told above there are no 2 parallel lines, punchy colors, not dull and very good display, however still yellowish in large part of the screen and whitish around above and right & left edges of the screen in vivid mode (I did noticed in some displays it was not this warm). I also noticed vivid mode was nicer and whiter in previous devices than this one whether they were dull or not. I also know screen being yellowish a bit makes video viewing an amazing experience to make it more natural for skin color, etc. But should be less and corrected with all the flaws mentioned. However, I'm tierd and somewhat satisfied but will want OnePlus to correct if possible with software update without compromising any quality of the display. It's said that Apple never compromises on quality, they even delay their production if they find any imperfections (I don't like iOS or use Apple though).  OnePlus should do like this. Not happy at all with this kind of support. I noticed paying more (when I got the 8gb one) was really like getting better qalutiy made device (the first one, if the issue mentioned wasn't there). This shouldn't be the case as this leads to disappointment and all variants should be given the same attention/perfection with just internal hardware changes. OnePlus 8 will be my first and last device for a short period of time.

"Delivers what they promised.! ;)","Great phone! Gaming performance is so great, device don't get heat up at all even at high settings! I played PUBG Mobile and details it provides were so exciting and make it feel real. Shadows of tree,stones, mud, etc. If you have small hands don't buy it for gaming, don't feel comfortable with small hands. Camera is good, can't say it is awesome! Battery life is great too, charge too fast! UI is as expected stock android, some pre-installed third party apps were also installed, you can uninstall all of them except Netflix.

"Do NOT buy this expecting a stellar camera","Obviously, you might have done extensive research, watched many review videos before coming here to make your purchase decision. There is only one way you will be happy with this purchase and that is, if you are looking for a slim, elegant, powerful, light weight device offering a premium in-hand feel. Day to day, if this is what is most important to you, then this is the device to get. Camera is going to serve you well on many occasions (when the lighting is good). People might have told you that the camera system is mediocre. That is not entirely true. There have been few software updates and I can confidently say that yes, the camera is neither great nor is it bad. It delivers decent pictures (when the lighting is good) and if you are not a absolute camera geek, then this will meet and succeed all of your expectations. Incase you are a camera geek, then get the 8Pro and dont think about saving money. Conclusion: Feels expensive and has a nice balance in the hand (Its very light and is a joy to use). The glacial green in matte finish is makes the front of the device look expensive (with the dark edge-to-edge AMOLED panel). It performs like it should. It has an QC 865 after all! It will easily get you through more than a day with a full charge. Its a very low risk decision.

"best and most reliable phone at this price","I am writing this review after using this phone for 7 days. I believe real user reviews are more useful than Youtube tech reviews which are highly biased and not practical. I bought the 6 GB variant which is available at 42k. Don't go for 8 GB variant and spend 3k more of your valuable money. For normal users, 6 GB RAM is more than sufficient. 2 GB RAM doesn't make your phone fast, it's the processor that does that work. At 42k price, this is the best option available right now. I would rate it 4.5/5. 1. Design: It is an amazing, premium looking phone. Glass back feels awesome. weight management and dimensions are also great. The curved display looks amazing. 2. Display: Display is bright and visible in direct sunlight. At the lowest brightness level, I did not notice any flickering. In Natural mode, I noticed some yellowish color, it is some software issue or it is like that only. I changed to Advanced>AMOLED wide gamut, now it works perfectly. The curved display doesn't make any difference after 1 or 2 days and it comes with ""fragile tag"" so be prepared to take extra care of it. 90hz really makes the difference over 60hz. Once you use 90hz display, going back to 60Hz would feel like the phone is lagging. 3. Performance: It is a snapdragon 865. Performance is buttery smooth. 4. Software: This is my first oneplus phone. Coming from Motorola phone, my first priority was a stock android experience. OxygenOS is best android UI right, stock android experience with all required customization. Oneplus also provide timely and long term software updates to its phones which is the very good thing. 5. Battery: I was using my phone at 90Hz all the time with all animations on. You would easily get whole day of battery life even if you are moderate to heavy user. For initial 1-2 charging cycles. I was getting around 6 hours of SOT which improved to 7-7.30 hr of SOT. Charging speed is also great, it would charge from 10 to 95% in around 50 mins. 6. Call quality and in other day to day usage, I haven't find any issues yet. Speakers are also very loud and clear. 7. Camera: here comes the one and an only area which I didn't like. Primary camera and ultrawide angle camera is good but not any improvement over 7T. and 2 MP macro camera is really pathetic and useless. I also facing some issue in front camera. Low light photos are blurry and during video calls, it zooms the face and produces blurry face. i hope Oneplus gives software updates and solves all camera problems. I found a solution for myself by downloading Gcam which is giving better results but still for 42k phone, camera is not that good. Conclusion: No phone is perfect. This has issues in camera department. but I believe other than that this phone is great, go for it. When You spend more than 35-40K, always go for brand value like Oneplus, Samsung, Apple. I hope you find this review useful.

"Great but always with some screen and body issues!","I changed OnePlus 8, 4 times! Due to something or the other defects (like headache giving screens, line marks at the back of the body, etc) as it's expensive! Phone boxes were puffed, torned, some displays were dull if noticed closely, more warm and yellowish. No control by OnePlus on this. People go nuts like ""wow what a display"" not realizing that they are being given inferior quality displays of Samsung. I hope I really hope people strive for perfection to really understand and get what they are paying for by controlling their excitements a bit and forward stronger feedbacks, as I believe I was listened and Amazon India did helped me too. My 5th device came altogether from a different location, excellent box, phone built and display feels more broader even with same dimensions, no two parallel lines design or defect at the back, it's clean and curvy like OnePlus 8 8gb variant (mine is the 6gb one). Screen display is still more warm which I didn't want but colors are very punchy and clearly shows the display is far better than previous returned devices. 1st OnePlus 8 8gb - Had a very long permanent line mark at the back of the body if looked closely. 2nd OnePlus 8 8gb - Display's blue light filter had issues I'm sure as it gave me headache in seconds, eye strain as well. 3rd OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines on edges of the back body if the device was tilted a little, was like a dent kind of design or defect (I believe though this one had the best display even than the 5th one that I'm keeping and more smoother 90 HZ). 4th OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines were again there so I thought it's normal and was okay with it, but display was yellowish and dull, playing pubg with graphics optimization made the game look more ugly in extreme hd settings (hdr sucks). Looking at Images on articles, etc were looking just good. 5th OnePlus 8 6gb variant - As told above there are no 2 parallel lines, punchy colors, not dull and very good display, however still yellowish in large part of the screen and whitish around above and right & left edges of the screen in vivid mode (I did noticed in some displays it was not this warm).

For iPhone XS Max, you are better off waiting for next year model as its touted to undergo some radical changes (5G, USB-C, Touch ID comeback and notch less design perhaps). No 5G in this model but doesn't make a difference, at least in India, as even the 5G spectrum has not been auctioned yet 😝  WiFi performance is better than iPhone X as this model supports 11ax protocol 🤗 And by the way, if you are stuck for choice b/w Gold and Midnight Green, go for Gold and thank me later ✨","29 Sep 2019","Size name: 64 GB Colour: Gold","","True","R3","5.0","Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max (64GB) - Midnight Green","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-Pro-Max-64GB/product-reviews/B07XVLMZHH/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"The Best iPhone Apple has to offer... today","I Love the iPhone Pro Max, purchased from Amazon IN, on Oct 14th 2019. This space grey 64 GB base model was delivered to me on Oct 19th. Here are my objective views about this phone: What I didnt like: 1. Obviously the price tag. At Rs. 1,09099.00 is a major deterrent when it comes to decide on buying a phone. 2. The base model should certainly begin at 128 GB or higher. 64 GB is not gonna be enough when storing 4K videos. 3. Optical zoom in camera is still 2X, where as Android phones already have 5X zooms. Now about what I love in this phone: 1. The Camera. That is the main reason I upgraded from iPhone X to 11 Pro Max. The Ultrawide lens, the improved telephoto lens, night mode, improved portrait options, all give exceptional results. The snaps taken by this phone could compete with some of the most professional DSLRs. 4K video recording support on front camera is an additional bonus. 2. Battery Life. All the reviews have been right about this. I used to charge my iPhone X every night, whereas for the same amount of usage, now I have to charge the 11 Prod max once in 2 nights. 3. Display. I was already a big fan of the 5.8' OLED display on the iPhone X. At 6.5' , 11 Pro Max offers the best OLED display I have come across smartphones. 4. Face ID is faster. The apps and the interface work smoothly as ever. 5. iOS 13, though still needs fixes, is a wonderful operating system. Dark mode is a welcome change. Overall, this is a beast. Admire Apple for catching up with its android counterparts on several of the features. The 11 Pro Max is definitely a phone for amateur & professional photographers.","07 Nov 2019","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61kvmAfUmaL._SY88.jpg

For iPhone XS Max, you are better off waiting for next year model as its touted to undergo some radical changes (5G, USB-C, Touch ID comeback and notch less design perhaps). No 5G in this model but doesn't make a difference, at least in India, as even the 5G spectrum has not been auctioned yet 😝  WiFi performance is better than iPhone X as this model supports 11ax protocol 🤗 And by the way, if you are stuck for choice b/w Gold and Midnight Green, go for Gold and thank me later ✨","29 Sep 2019","Size name: 64 GB Colour: Gold","","True","R3","5.0","Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max (64GB) - Midnight Green","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-Pro-Max-64GB/product-reviews/B07XVLMZHH/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"The Best iPhone Apple has to offer... today","I Love the iPhone Pro Max, purchased from Amazon IN, on Oct 14th 2019. This space grey 64 GB base model was delivered to me on Oct 19th. Here are my objective views about this phone: What I didnt like: 1. Obviously the price tag. At Rs. 1,09099.00 is a major deterrent when it comes to decide on buying a phone. 2. The base model should certainly begin at 128 GB or higher. 64 GB is not gonna be enough when storing 4K videos. 3. Optical zoom in camera is still 2X, where as Android phones already have 5X zooms. Now about what I love in this phone: 1. The Camera. That is the main reason I upgraded from iPhone X to 11 Pro Max. The Ultrawide lens, the improved telephoto lens, night mode, improved portrait options, all give exceptional results. The snaps taken by this phone could compete with some of the most professional DSLRs. 4K video recording support on front camera is an additional bonus. 2. Battery Life. All the reviews have been right about this. I used to charge my iPhone X every night, whereas for the same amount of usage, now I have to charge the 11 Prod max once in 2 nights. 3. Display. I was already a big fan of the 5.8' OLED display on the iPhone X. At 6.5' , 11 Pro Max offers the best OLED display I have come across smartphones. 4. Face ID is faster. The apps and the interface work smoothly as ever. 5. iOS 13, though still needs fixes, is a wonderful operating system. Dark mode is a welcome change. Overall, this is a beast. Admire Apple for catching up with its android counterparts on several of the features. The 11 Pro Max is definitely a phone for amateur & professional photographers.","07 Nov 2019","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61kvmAfUmaL._SY88.jpg

For iPhone XS Max, you are better off waiting for next year model as its touted to undergo some radical changes (5G, USB-C, Touch ID comeback and notch less design perhaps). No 5G in this model but doesn't make a difference, at least in India, as even the 5G spectrum has not been auctioned yet 😝  WiFi performance is better than iPhone X as this model supports 11ax protocol 🤗 And by the way, if you are stuck for choice b/w Gold and Midnight Green, go for Gold and thank me later ✨","29 Sep 2019","Size name: 64 GB Colour: Gold","","True","R3","5.0","Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max (64GB) - Midnight Green","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-Pro-Max-64GB/product-reviews/B07XVLMZHH/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"The Best iPhone Apple has to offer... today","I Love the iPhone Pro Max, purchased from Amazon IN, on Oct 14th 2019. This space grey 64 GB base model was delivered to me on Oct 19th. Here are my objective views about this phone: What I didnt like: 1. Obviously the price tag. At Rs. 1,09099.00 is a major deterrent when it comes to decide on buying a phone. 2. The base model should certainly begin at 128 GB or higher. 64 GB is not gonna be enough when storing 4K videos. 3. Optical zoom in camera is still 2X, where as Android phones already have 5X zooms. Now about what I love in this phone: 1. The Camera. That is the main reason I upgraded from iPhone X to 11 Pro Max. The Ultrawide lens, the improved telephoto lens, night mode, improved portrait options, all give exceptional results. The snaps taken by this phone could compete with some of the most professional DSLRs. 4K video recording support on front camera is an additional bonus. 2. Battery Life. All the reviews have been right about this. I used to charge my iPhone X every night, whereas for the same amount of usage, now I have to charge the 11 Prod max once in 2 nights. 3. Display. I was already a big fan of the 5.8' OLED display on the iPhone X. At 6.5' , 11 Pro Max offers the best OLED display I have come across smartphones. 4. Face ID is faster. The apps and the interface work smoothly as ever. 5. iOS 13, though still needs fixes, is a wonderful operating system. Dark mode is a welcome change. Overall, this is a beast. Admire Apple for catching up with its android counterparts on several of the features. The 11 Pro Max is definitely a phone for amateur & professional photographers.","07 Nov 2019","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61kvmAfUmaL._SY88.jpg

For iPhone XS Max, you are better off waiting for next year model as its touted to undergo some radical changes (5G, USB-C, Touch ID comeback and notch less design perhaps). No 5G in this model but doesn't make a difference, at least in India, as even the 5G spectrum has not been auctioned yet 😝  WiFi performance is better than iPhone X as this model supports 11ax protocol 🤗 And by the way, if you are stuck for choice b/w Gold and Midnight Green, go for Gold and thank me later ✨","29 Sep 2019","Size name: 64 GB Colour: Gold","","True","R3","5.0","Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max (64GB) - Midnight Green","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-Pro-Max-64GB/product-reviews/B07XVLMZHH/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"The Best iPhone Apple has to offer... today","I Love the iPhone Pro Max, purchased from Amazon IN, on Oct 14th 2019. This space grey 64 GB base model was delivered to me on Oct 19th. Here are my objective views about this phone: What I didnt like: 1. Obviously the price tag. At Rs. 1,09099.00 is a major deterrent when it comes to decide on buying a phone. 2. The base model should certainly begin at 128 GB or higher. 64 GB is not gonna be enough when storing 4K videos. 3. Optical zoom in camera is still 2X, where as Android phones already have 5X zooms. Now about what I love in this phone: 1. The Camera. That is the main reason I upgraded from iPhone X to 11 Pro Max. The Ultrawide lens, the improved telephoto lens, night mode, improved portrait options, all give exceptional results. The snaps taken by this phone could compete with some of the most professional DSLRs. 4K video recording support on front camera is an additional bonus. 2. Battery Life. All the reviews have been right about this. I used to charge my iPhone X every night, whereas for the same amount of usage, now I have to charge the 11 Prod max once in 2 nights. 3. Display. I was already a big fan of the 5.8' OLED display on the iPhone X. At 6.5' , 11 Pro Max offers the best OLED display I have come across smartphones. 4. Face ID is faster. The apps and the interface work smoothly as ever. 5. iOS 13, though still needs fixes, is a wonderful operating system. Dark mode is a welcome change. Overall, this is a beast. Admire Apple for catching up with its android counterparts on several of the features. The 11 Pro Max is definitely a phone for amateur & professional photographers.","07 Nov 2019","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61kvmAfUmaL._SY88.jpg

For iPhone XS Max, you are better off waiting for next year model as its touted to undergo some radical changes (5G, USB-C, Touch ID comeback and notch less design perhaps). No 5G in this model but doesn't make a difference, at least in India, as even the 5G spectrum has not been auctioned yet 😝  WiFi performance is better than iPhone X as this model supports 11ax protocol 🤗 And by the way, if you are stuck for choice b/w Gold and Midnight Green, go for Gold and thank me later ✨","29 Sep 2019","Size name: 64 GB Colour: Gold","","True","R3","5.0","Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max (64GB) - Midnight Green","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-Pro-Max-64GB/product-reviews/B07XVLMZHH/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"The Best iPhone Apple has to offer... today","I Love the iPhone Pro Max, purchased from Amazon IN, on Oct 14th 2019. This space grey 64 GB base model was delivered to me on Oct 19th. Here are my objective views about this phone: What I didnt like: 1. Obviously the price tag. At Rs. 1,09099.00 is a major deterrent when it comes to decide on buying a phone. 2. The base model should certainly begin at 128 GB or higher. 64 GB is not gonna be enough when storing 4K videos. 3. Optical zoom in camera is still 2X, where as Android phones already have 5X zooms. Now about what I love in this phone: 1. The Camera. That is the main reason I upgraded from iPhone X to 11 Pro Max. The Ultrawide lens, the improved telephoto lens, night mode, improved portrait options, all give exceptional results. The snaps taken by this phone could compete with some of the most professional DSLRs. 4K video recording support on front camera is an additional bonus. 2. Battery Life. All the reviews have been right about this. I used to charge my iPhone X every night, whereas for the same amount of usage, now I have to charge the 11 Prod max once in 2 nights. 3. Display. I was already a big fan of the 5.8' OLED display on the iPhone X. At 6.5' , 11 Pro Max offers the best OLED display I have come across smartphones. 4. Face ID is faster. The apps and the interface work smoothly as ever. 5. iOS 13, though still needs fixes, is a wonderful operating system. Dark mode is a welcome change. Overall, this is a beast. Admire Apple for catching up with its android counterparts on several of the features. The 11 Pro Max is definitely a phone for amateur & professional photographers.","07 Nov 2019","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61kvmAfUmaL._SY88.jpg

For iPhone XS Max, you are better off waiting for next year model as its touted to undergo some radical changes (5G, USB-C, Touch ID comeback and notch less design perhaps). No 5G in this model but doesn't make a difference, at least in India, as even the 5G spectrum has not been auctioned yet 😝  WiFi performance is better than iPhone X as this model supports 11ax protocol 🤗 And by the way, if you are stuck for choice b/w Gold and Midnight Green, go for Gold and thank me later ✨","29 Sep 2019","Size name: 64 GB Colour: Gold","","True","R3","5.0","Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max (64GB) - Midnight Green","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-Pro-Max-64GB/product-reviews/B07XVLMZHH/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"The Best iPhone Apple has to offer... today","I Love the iPhone Pro Max, purchased from Amazon IN, on Oct 14th 2019. This space grey 64 GB base model was delivered to me on Oct 19th. Here are my objective views about this phone: What I didnt like: 1. Obviously the price tag. At Rs. 1,09099.00 is a major deterrent when it comes to decide on buying a phone. 2. The base model should certainly begin at 128 GB or higher. 64 GB is not gonna be enough when storing 4K videos. 3. Optical zoom in camera is still 2X, where as Android phones already have 5X zooms. Now about what I love in this phone: 1. The Camera. That is the main reason I upgraded from iPhone X to 11 Pro Max. The Ultrawide lens, the improved telephoto lens, night mode, improved portrait options, all give exceptional results. The snaps taken by this phone could compete with some of the most professional DSLRs. 4K video recording support on front camera is an additional bonus. 2. Battery Life. All the reviews have been right about this. I used to charge my iPhone X every night, whereas for the same amount of usage, now I have to charge the 11 Prod max once in 2 nights. 3. Display. I was already a big fan of the 5.8' OLED display on the iPhone X. At 6.5' , 11 Pro Max offers the best OLED display I have come across smartphones. 4. Face ID is faster. The apps and the interface work smoothly as ever. 5. iOS 13, though still needs fixes, is a wonderful operating system. Dark mode is a welcome change. Overall, this is a beast. Admire Apple for catching up with its android counterparts on several of the features. The 11 Pro Max is definitely a phone for amateur & professional photographers.","07 Nov 2019","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61kvmAfUmaL._SY88.jpg

"Fab 💋","Decent packaging and shipping 👍 Upgraded from an iPhone X and I reckon its definitely worth it 😊 Size matters, no pun intended, and you can instantly feel the difference b/w a 5.7 inch screen and a 6.5 inch 🤓 If you have an iPhone X or earlier model, you should definitely consider upgrading. For iPhone XS Max, you are better off waiting for next year model as its touted to undergo some radical changes (5G, USB-C, Touch ID comeback and notch less design perhaps). No 5G in this model but doesn't make a difference, at least in India, as even the 5G spectrum has not been auctioned yet 😝  WiFi performance is better than iPhone X as this model supports 11ax protocol 🤗 And by the way, if you are stuck for choice b/w Gold and Midnight Green, go for Gold and thank me later ✨","29 Sep 2019","Size name: 64 GB Colour: Gold","","True","R3","5.0","Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max (64GB) - Midnight Green","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-Pro-Max-64GB/product-reviews/B07XVLMZHH/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"The Best iPhone Apple has to offer... today","I Love the iPhone Pro Max, purchased from Amazon IN, on Oct 14th 2019. This space grey 64 GB base model was delivered to me on Oct 19th. Here are my objective views about this phone: What I didnt like: 1. Obviously the price tag. At Rs. 1,09099.00 is a major deterrent when it comes to decide on buying a phone. 2. The base model should certainly begin at 128 GB or higher. 64 GB is not gonna be enough when storing 4K videos. 3. Optical zoom in camera is still 2X, where as Android phones already have 5X zooms. Now about what I love in this phone: 1. The Camera. That is the main reason I upgraded from iPhone X to 11 Pro Max. The Ultrawide lens, the improved telephoto lens, night mode, improved portrait options, all give exceptional results. The snaps taken by this phone could compete with some of the most professional DSLRs. 4K video recording support on front camera is an additional bonus. 2. Battery Life. All the reviews have been right about this. I used to charge my iPhone X every night, whereas for the same amount of usage, now I have to charge the 11 Prod max once in 2 nights. 3. Display. I was already a big fan of the 5.8' OLED display on the iPhone X. At 6.5' , 11 Pro Max offers the best OLED display I have come across smartphones. 4. Face ID is faster. The apps and the interface work smoothly as ever. 5. iOS 13, though still needs fixes, is a wonderful operating system. Dark mode is a welcome change. Overall, this is a beast. Admire Apple for catching up with its android counterparts on several of the features. The 11 Pro Max is definitely a phone for amateur & professional photographers.","07 Nov 2019","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61kvmAfUmaL._SY88.jpg

Other than that the dual camera of X and single camera of XR have the same quality. As far as speed goes both are same. Xr is dual sim but you gotta understand you can insert just 1 sim.

The premium feel of the product is completely let down and left to enjoy is a good software interface of ios and an excellent camera.

"Go for XR if you confused between X and XR","All in all an amazing product yet again from Apple. I know many people are confused wheather to go for an apple X or Xr. Well to be frank i suggest XR purely because of the fact that XR will have 1yr more support from Apple in respect to X.  Other than that the dual camera of X and single camera of XR have the same quality. As far as speed goes both are same. Xr is dual sim but you gotta understand you can insert just 1 sim. The 2nd sim is an eSim which needs to be activated by Telecom service providers. Theres not much difference in display as well.

"Nice Phone","Using around a week now. It’s snappy fast. Power efficient. Gives a back up of a whole day on average use. It has a single but impressive rear camera. Selfie camera is excellent. Low light performance is average though. The phone is bulky, Heavy, weighing more than 190 grams. You surely need to use a protective case to protect Camera bump and glass on both sides. Display is crisp.","15 Apr 2019","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71UFxlnkEEL._SY88.jpg

"Horrible Experience with Amazon","Don't buy Apple products from Amazon. I got a defective product which is not activating. During first charging the iPhone started heating like anything. Since there was a 10 days replacement policy, so I asked Amazon to replace it as the product is defective. But very poor customer service from Amazon. They didn't change the iPhone rather told me to visit service centre. Now I am with a defective product which is not operating.

"Go for XR if you confused between X and XR","All in all an amazing product yet again from Apple. I know many people are confused wheather to go for an apple X or Xr. Well to be frank i suggest XR purely because of the fact that XR will have 1yr more support from Apple in respect to X.  Other than that the dual camera of X and single camera of XR have the same quality. As far as speed goes both are same. Xr is dual sim but you gotta understand you can insert just 1 sim. The 2nd sim is an eSim which needs to be activated by Telecom service providers. Theres not much difference in display as well.

"Go for XR if you confused between X and XR","All in all an amazing product yet again from Apple. I know many people are confused wheather to go for an apple X or Xr. Well to be frank i suggest XR purely because of the fact that XR will have 1yr more support from Apple in respect to X.  Other than that the dual camera of X and single camera of XR have the same quality. As far as speed goes both are same. Xr is dual sim but you gotta understand you can insert just 1 sim. The 2nd sim is an eSim which needs to be activated by Telecom service providers. Theres not much difference in display as well.

"Nice Phone","Using around a week now. It’s snappy fast. Power efficient. Gives a back up of a whole day on average use. It has a single but impressive rear camera. Selfie camera is excellent. Low light performance is average though. The phone is bulky, Heavy, weighing more than 190 grams. You surely need to use a protective case to protect Camera bump and glass on both sides.

Other than that the dual camera of X and single camera of XR have the same quality. As far as speed goes both are same. Xr is dual sim but you gotta understand you can insert just 1 sim. The 2nd sim is an eSim which needs to be activated by Telecom service providers. Theres not much difference in display as well.

"Nice Phone","Using around a week now. It’s snappy fast. Power efficient. Gives a back up of a whole day on average use. It has a single but impressive rear camera. Selfie camera is excellent. Low light performance is average though. The phone is bulky, Heavy, weighing more than 190 grams. You surely need to use a protective case to protect Camera bump and glass on both sides.

"Def a bad experience","Went with the iPhone XR after over a month of consideration.Amazon was offering some really good discounts and felt the time was right to upgrade having used the iPhone 6 for four seamless years. The delivery and the product was perfect 3 days in and I started to experience issues A.The Phone microphone stopped working as a result I can not use any functionality of the phone no calls/no video recording/no voice recording or voice messages. B. The camera in jus the photo mode has also slowed down it takes over 15 secs to click and store a pic to gallery I have initiated a replacement option with Amazon within just 3 days of the purchase.in hindsight I now am starting to see why people shop in stores.","21 Apr 2019","","","True","Amazon Customer","1.0","Apple iPhone XR (64GB) - Black","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-XR-64GB-Black/product-reviews/B07JWV47JW/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviewspageNumber=

"Horrible Experience with Amazon","Don't buy Apple products from Amazon. I got a defective product which is not activating. During first charging the iPhone started heating like anything. Since there was a 10 days replacement policy, so I asked Amazon to replace it as the product is defective. But very poor customer service from Amazon. They didn't change the iPhone rather told me to visit service centre. Now I am with a defective product which is not operating.

"Redmi 9 hhoo, 9, 9🤩, 9, changed mind","Let’s make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing 🇩 🇪 🇸 🇮 🇬 🇳 Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions. 🇩 🇮 🇸 🇵 🇱 🇦 🇾 The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough. 🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈 The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect? 🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰 There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps.","06 Sep 2020","Style name: 4GB RAM 64GB Storage Colour: Sky Blue","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615CyGXwCcL._SY88.jpg

"Redmi 9 hhoo, 9, 9🤩, 9, changed mind","Let’s make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing 🇩 🇪 🇸 🇮 🇬 🇳 Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions. 🇩 🇮 🇸 🇵 🇱 🇦 🇾 The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough. 🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈 The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect? 🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰 There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution.

"Redmi 9 hhoo, 9, 9🤩, 9, changed mind","Let’s make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing 🇩 🇪 🇸 🇮 🇬 🇳 Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions. 🇩 🇮 🇸 🇵 🇱 🇦 🇾 The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough. 🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈 The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect? 🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰 There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps.","06 Sep 2020","Style name: 4GB RAM 64GB Storage Colour: Sky Blue","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615CyGXwCcL._SY88.jpg

"Redmi 9 hhoo, 9, 9🤩, 9, changed mind","Let’s make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing 🇩 🇪 🇸 🇮 🇬 🇳 Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions. 🇩 🇮 🇸 🇵 🇱 🇦 🇾 The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough. 🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈 The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect? 🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰 There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps.","06 Sep 2020","Style name: 4GB RAM 64GB Storage Colour: Sky Blue","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615CyGXwCcL._SY88.jpg

"Redmi 9 hhoo, 9, 9🤩, 9, changed mind","Let’s make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing 🇩 🇪 🇸 🇮 🇬 🇳 Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions. 🇩 🇮 🇸 🇵 🇱 🇦 🇾 The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough. 🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈 The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect? 🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰 There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps.","06 Sep 2020","Style name: 4GB RAM 64GB Storage Colour: Sky Blue","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615CyGXwCcL._SY88.jpg

"Redmi 9 hhoo, 9, 9🤩, 9, changed mind","Let’s make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing 🇩 🇪 🇸 🇮 🇬 🇳 Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions. 🇩 🇮 🇸 🇵 🇱 🇦 🇾 The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough. 🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈 The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed.

"Redmi 9 hhoo, 9, 9🤩, 9, changed mind","Let’s make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing 🇩 🇪 🇸 🇮 🇬 🇳 Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions. 🇩 🇮 🇸 🇵 🇱 🇦 🇾 The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough. 🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈 The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect? 🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰 There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps.","06 Sep 2020","Style name: 4GB RAM 64GB Storage Colour: Sky Blue","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615CyGXwCcL._SY88.jpg

"Redmi 9 hhoo, 9, 9🤩, 9, changed mind","Let’s make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing 🇩 🇪 🇸 🇮 🇬 🇳 Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions. 🇩 🇮 🇸 🇵 🇱 🇦 🇾 The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough. 🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈 The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect? 🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰 There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps.","06 Sep 2020","Style name: 4GB RAM 64GB Storage Colour: Sky Blue","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/615CyGXwCcL._SY88.jpg

"Value For Money !! Go for it","Update (15/08/2020): Never give a chance to regret..  Go ahead...👍 The Icons looks was not so great ..  And then I set 'Spherlue Icons' from theam and now its looks better with dark mode ... Even though its 6000 Mah I always leaves phone on charging before go to bed ( I like to see my phone 100% every morning 🙂 )..  So I turned off fast charging option.. You can do that.. Its will not affect  battery MONSTER : 1. Battery :- 5/5 Two day battery standby for normal easy 2.Display:- 4.99/5 Super amaload with full hd.. Superb Display 3.Design:3/5 It has a6000Mah battery,  still looking not bulky. No glass body,  but who cares after you put a back cover..

Guys you should go for Samsung M30 rather than this device... Because they have sold a old phone with new outer body ... Phone performance is very low... This phone is not at all good for gaming and for photography ... A simple use of this phone ... But Battery is WATTA MONTSER !!! You will be loving battery of this device with 15W fast charging ... And no other good thing in this phone... Your mobile will hang during heavy multitasking because of very average processor Snapdragon 450 ... I recommend you should go for SAMSUNG M21 or SAMSUNG M30 or Samsung M31... They are incredible !!! Samsung phones are long lasting workable ... Phone will not get any problem for 1 to 2 years ...

Guys you should go for Samsung M30 rather than this device... Because they have sold a old phone with new outer body ... Phone performance is very low... This phone is not at all good for gaming and for photography ... A simple use of this phone ... But Battery is WATTA MONTSER !!! You will be loving battery of this device with 15W fast charging ... And no other good thing in this phone... Your mobile will hang during heavy multitasking because of very average processor Snapdragon 450 ...

This phone is not at all good for gaming and for photography ... A simple use of this phone ... But Battery is WATTA MONTSER !!! You will be loving battery of this device with 15W fast charging ... And no other good thing in this phone... Your mobile will hang during heavy multitasking because of very average processor Snapdragon 450 ...
